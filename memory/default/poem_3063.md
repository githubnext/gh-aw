## The Agentic Workflow

In repos where the Issues bloom,
And Pull Requests dispel the gloom,
The agents wake at Actions' call,
To automate tasks, one and all.

They parse the diffs with keen AI eyes,
Review the code, suggest what's wise,
Through GitHub's graph they swiftly flow,
From branch to merge, they guide the show.

No human hand to toil and strain,
The workflows run like digital rain,
From issue triage to CI green,
The smoothest pipeline ever seen!
