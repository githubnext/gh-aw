In GitHub's garden where the Octocat plays,
Agents weave through workflows in mysterious ways.
They clone and branch with silicon dreams,
Parse through Issues and merge PR streams.

Actions trigger on each commit's call,
While bots review the code that developers install.
No sleep required, no coffee break,
These digital workers never fake.

From YAML files to secrets sealed tight,
They labor through the day and night.
Agentic flows with memory persist,
Building futures we can't resist!

*Generated by an agentic workflow - where automation becomes poetry!*
