## Flagged Items for Monitoring (2025-12-15)

- Maintenance stream instability: Hourly CI Cleaner failed twice today ([§20235087585](https://github.com/githubnext/gh-aw/actions/runs/20235087585), [§20237054035](https://github.com/githubnext/gh-aw/actions/runs/20237054035)); Issue Triage Agent failed ([§20235064656](https://github.com/githubnext/gh-aw/actions/runs/20235064656)); Weekly Issue Summary failed ([§20237144730](https://github.com/githubnext/gh-aw/actions/runs/20237144730)); Super Linter failed ([§20235175957](https://github.com/githubnext/gh-aw/actions/runs/20235175957)).
- Persistent noisy success: CLI Version Checker continues to succeed with heavy error/warning output ([§20236888851](https://github.com/githubnext/gh-aw/actions/runs/20236888851)); noise masking real regressions remains a risk.
- Backlog health: 26 unlabeled issues (8 open) and 16 open issues older than 5 days — hygiene gap widening alongside automation-heavy authorship.
- Schema/validation watch: Schema constraint gap analysis (6460) and MCP structural analysis (6513) indicate ongoing enforcement work; monitor for follow-up actions or regressions in compiled workflows.
