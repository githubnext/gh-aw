## Flagged Items for Monitoring (2025-12-17)

- Workflow log noise: Recent successes still emit 5 errors/15 warnings ([§20307028195](https://github.com/githubnext/gh-aw/actions/runs/20307028195), [§20306579260](https://github.com/githubnext/gh-aw/actions/runs/20306579260)); risk of masking true issues.
- Isolated fresh failure: One failure in last 10 runs ([§20307129292](https://github.com/githubnext/gh-aw/actions/runs/20307129292))—watch if it recurs.
- Unlabeled issues: 26 unlabeled remain (8 open); hygiene gap persists even as total open count falls.
