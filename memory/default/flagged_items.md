## Flagged Items for Monitoring (2025-12-18)

- Workflow noise and failures: 3 failures/cancellations in last 10 runs (e.g., [§20338172675](https://github.com/githubnext/gh-aw/actions/runs/20338172675), [§20337933624](https://github.com/githubnext/gh-aw/actions/runs/20337933624)), and “successful” runs still log high errors/warnings ([§20337316176](https://github.com/githubnext/gh-aw/actions/runs/20337316176) 113 errors; [§20337284655](https://github.com/githubnext/gh-aw/actions/runs/20337284655) 19 errors/16 warnings).
- Token spend uptick: last 10 runs consumed ~1.71M tokens (up ~4x vs prior snapshot), suggesting heavier analyses or verbose prompts.
- Issue hygiene regression: total issues up to 213 with 19 open; unlabeled still 27 (6 open). Label skew (`plan`/`ai-generated` 124 each) unchanged, so triage pressure remains.
