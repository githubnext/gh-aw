## Flagged Items for Monitoring (2025-12-10)

- Copilot PR Merged report failing again: discussion [6040](https://github.com/githubnext/gh-aw/discussions/6040) is an error state following yesterday’s report [5963](https://github.com/githubnext/gh-aw/discussions/5963) update — inspect workflow inputs or data fetches.
- Portfolio Analysis limited run: discussion [6038](https://github.com/githubnext/gh-aw/discussions/6038) notes “Limited Analysis,” implying data gaps or upstream timeouts.
- Automation label skew endures: `ai-generated` (101) and `plan` (98) still mask human-authored issues in the weekly set — consider filters/summaries that surface non-automation items.
- Reduced issue volume (15 on Dec 9, 5 so far on Dec 10) may hide latent backlog rather than resolution; watch open count (54) to ensure closure pace holds.
- Workflow log retrieval blocked by unauthenticated gh CLI — rerun `gh-aw logs` once auth is available to confirm whether earlier instability (Issue Monster/Super Linter) persists.
