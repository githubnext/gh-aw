## Flagged Items for Monitoring (2025-12-16)

- Moderation instability: AI Moderator failed in three recent runs ([§20272748002](https://github.com/githubnext/gh-aw/actions/runs/20272748002), [§20271807889](https://github.com/githubnext/gh-aw/actions/runs/20271807889), [§20271315549](https://github.com/githubnext/gh-aw/actions/runs/20271315549)).
- Noisy success risk: CLI Version Checker succeeded but logged 116 errors/25 warnings ([§20272475885](https://github.com/githubnext/gh-aw/actions/runs/20272475885)); potential signal hiding remains.
- Maintenance follow-up: Hourly CI Cleaner recovered with warnings ([§20272632487](https://github.com/githubnext/gh-aw/actions/runs/20272632487)); watch for regression after earlier failures.
- Backlog hygiene: 26 unlabeled issues (9 open) persist despite overall open count dropping to 16; keep unlabeled clean-up in focus.
