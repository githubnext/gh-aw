## Known Patterns (2025-12-17)

- Documentation quality push accelerated: multiple fresh doc-centric reports (6735 quality improvements, 6734 and 6707 noob tests) landing the same day as new Typist/type-consistency (6723) indicate sustained investment in docs clarity and type hygiene.
- Structural audits remain daily: new MCP structural pass (6724) and continued Issue Arborist runs (6714 security hardening cluster, 6689 linking) show recurring infrastructure/consistency reviews.
- Workflow noise persists but reduced: latest completed runs show recurring warning/error chatter even on successes (e.g., §20307028195, §20306579260), though only one failure surfaced in the last 10 runs.
- Backlog keeps shrinking: weekly slice now 201 issues with 13 open (down from 16); `plan`/`ai-generated` labels still dominate at 113 each and unlabeled issues remain at 26 (8 open), keeping hygiene a steady concern.
