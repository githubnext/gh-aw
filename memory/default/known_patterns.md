## Known Patterns (2025-12-09)

- Automated reporting remains dense: daily static analysis, firewall, prompt-analysis, Issue Arborist, and documentation sweeps continue to publish across Audits/Announcements/General categories with new entries on Dec 9.
- Workflow instability clusters around Copilot-heavy jobs: Issue Monster shows repeated failures (two in last 24h plus an in-progress run already emitting errors), Issue Triage failed once, and Super Linter failed the latest run.
- Token and error concentration: small run volume (10) still consumed ~5.1M tokens; CLI Version Checker alone used ~1.4M tokens and logged 123 errors despite success.
- Issue labeling skew persists: `ai-generated` (118) and `plan` (109) lead counts; automation/code-quality remain top tags, signaling largely automated issue flow.
- Issue creation peaks on Dec 7–8 (31, 36) eased to 14 on Dec 9 so far, but open issues remain elevated (58/231 for the week).
