## Known Patterns (2025-12-10)

- Automation cadence unchanged: daily static analysis, firewall, prompt-analysis, Issue Arborist, documentation consolidation, and team-status drops continue across Audits/Announcements/General with fresh Dec 10 entries.
- Copilot PR merged reporting is brittle: a new error discussion ([6040](https://github.com/githubnext/gh-aw/discussions/6040)) landed minutes after the prior run ([5963](https://github.com/githubnext/gh-aw/discussions/5963)) updated, suggesting recurring instability in that workflow.
- Portfolio and quality reports lean on reduced scope: Portfolio Analysis (6038) labeled “Limited Analysis” and performance/doc-quality reports remain highly templated, hinting at partial data coverage.
- Issue stream still automation-heavy: github-actions authored 181/206 issues this week, and labels `ai-generated` (101) / `plan` (98) dominate, keeping manual signals buried.
- Issue volume is tapering after the Dec 7–8 spike (31/36); Dec 9 produced 15, and Dec 10 is currently at 5, with open issues down to 54/206 in the weekly slice.
