## Known Patterns (2025-12-18)

- Prompt scrutiny surge: two prompt-analysis drops (6845, 6771) plus fresh prompt-clustering (6814) keep Copilot prompt quality under daily review, indicating sustained tuning pressure.
- Typing and module hygiene cadence: Typist type-consistency (6829) and Go module reviews (6818, 6706) continue the code-quality lane alongside new doc consolidation (6826) and documentation noob testing (6819).
- MCP/infra audits stay daily: consecutive MCP structural reports (6828, 6724) and firewall daily audit (6853) show ongoing platform hardening.
- Workflow noise persists with higher failure rate: last 10 runs include 3 failures/cancellations and successes still emit double-digit warnings/errors (e.g., §20337316176 with 113 errors, §20337284655 with 19 errors), so signal remains noisy.
- Issue hygiene wobble: weekly slice grew to 213 issues with 19 open (up from 13); label skew unchanged (`plan`/`ai-generated` 124 each) and unlabeled still 27 (6 open), so backlog trimming slowed.
