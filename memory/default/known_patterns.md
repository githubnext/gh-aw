## Known Patterns (2025-12-12)

- Cost/efficiency focus rising: new discussion 6264 (“Workflow Cost Optimization & Resource Awareness”) pairs with lockfile stats 6208, signaling a shift from pure hygiene to spend control and artifact footprint.
- Schema correctness remains under scrutiny: fresh schema consistency audit 6199 (implicit validation constraints) follows 6084; prompt-analysis/copilot streams continue daily.
- Copilot PR merged pipeline instability continues: 6144 just published; prior run 6040 was error and today’s execution is still in-flight.
- Schedule agents recovering unevenly: Hourly CI Cleaner succeeded with heavy token burn (4.9M) and warnings; Issue Monster shows a healthy pass; Issue Triage Agent recorded a fresh failure (20169226915).
- Label skew persists: `plan`/`ai-generated` remain top (97 each) and github-actions continues to author the vast majority of issues; automation-driven backlog still shapes the queue.
