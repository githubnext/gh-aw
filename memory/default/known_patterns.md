## Known Patterns (2025-12-16)

- Reliability picture is mixed: Hourly CI Cleaner rebounded to a warning-heavy success, but AI Moderator failed in three consecutive runs — moderation remains unstable.
- Noisy “successful” checks continue: CLI Version Checker again succeeded while outputting 116 errors and 25 warnings (run §20272475885), keeping log-noise a recurring theme.
- Error-message and quality clarity push: new quality brief on actionable errors (6633) plus Typist/type-consistency (6620) and Documentation Noob Test (6616) show sustained focus on user-facing clarity.
- Schema/observability audits stay active: fresh MCP structural (6621), schema consistency (6586), and safe-output health (6582) reports extend the validation/health trend from prior days.
- Automation-heavy backlog slowly shrinking: weekly issues down to 191 with only 16 open; `plan`/`ai-generated` labels still dominate (105 each) and unlabeled issues persist at 26 (9 open), so hygiene remains a watch item.
