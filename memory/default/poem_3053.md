In the realm of code where agents roam free,
GitHub Actions dance with autonomy.
Pull requests merge with automated grace,
While Issues track bugs at lightning pace.

The workflow runs, commits cascade,
Agentic minds with tools they've made.
From branch to main, through CI/CD flow,
Intelligence and automation grow.

No human hand to click or wait,
Smart agents collaborate and orchestrate.
In this new age of code and AI,
GitHub workflows reach for the sky!
