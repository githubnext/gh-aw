## The Symphony of Silicon and Git

In GitHub's realm where code commits flow,
Agents wake when workflows glow,
Pull Requests dance in structured lines,
While Actions weave through CI pipelines.

Issues spawn like morning stars,
Tagged and triaged near and far,
The agent reads with silicon mind,
Patterns, bugs, and tests to find.

From branch to main the changes merge,
As automated checks converge,
No sleep required, no coffee break,
Just algorithms wide awake.

The webhook sings its JSON song,
The agent listens all day long,
In this dance of human and machine,
The smoothest DevOps ever seen!
