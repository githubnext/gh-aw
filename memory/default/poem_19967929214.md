In branches where the code flows free,
Where Issues spark like stars at night,
The agents work in harmony,
Automating workflows left and right.

Pull Requests merge with graceful ease,
As Actions run their scripted dance,
From commits pushed across the seas,
To CI/CD's automated trance.

GitHub's forge of collaboration bright,
Where bots and humans intertwine,
Agentic workflows take their flight,
Transforming code from yours to mine.

*Generated by an agentic workflow - proving that even AI can appreciate the poetry of automation!*
