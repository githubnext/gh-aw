In repos where the code commits flow,
Where Issues track what we should know,
The agents work through night and day,
Automating every workflow's way.

Pull Requests merge with thoughtful care,
While Actions run beyond compare,
From branch to branch the changes dance,
As CI/CD takes its stance.

The bots respond with helpful grace,
Each task finds its rightful place,
In GitHub's realm where systems gleam,
We build tomorrow's automated dream.
