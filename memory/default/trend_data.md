- Issue hygiene: 26 unlabeled issues (8 open); 16 open issues older than 5 days. Creation spikes: Dec 8 (36) and Dec 15 (24) lead the week; Dec 12 (26) and Dec 11 (19) follow.
- Discussion cadence: fresh observability/quality pushes (6533), tree map snapshot (6535), schema constraint gap analysis (6460), lockfile stats refresh (6463), and daily audit streams (firewall/code metrics/prompt analysis) continue uninterrupted.
