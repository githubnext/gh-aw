# Python Visualization Requirements for Trend Charts
# These packages are needed for generating firewall trend charts

Required packages:
- pandas (data manipulation and analysis)
- matplotlib (chart generation)
- seaborn (advanced visualization styling)

Installation command:
  python3 -m pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn

Note: The current GitHub Actions runner environment does not have pip installed
or these packages available. Future enhancements should include these in the
workflow environment setup.

Alternative solutions:
1. Use a Python container with pre-installed scientific packages
2. Install packages via apt-get if available in Ubuntu repos
3. Use a pre-configured Python environment action
4. Generate charts using a different tool (gnuplot, R, etc.)
