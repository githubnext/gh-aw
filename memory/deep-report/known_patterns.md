## Known Patterns (2026-01-21)

- Token spend remains concentrated in CI Cleaner and Issue Monster; CI Cleaner averages 5.2M tokens/run and dominates 19.8% of 30-day Copilot cost.
- MCP tooling reliability gaps persist: auth-test workflows report missing MCP tools in runtime, blocking remote MCP validation.
- GitHub MCP payload bloat is recurrent in list_releases and list_code_scanning_alerts; tool responses exceed typical context budgets.
- Safe outputs show a short-term stability spike (100% success in the last 24h), indicating recent remediation effectiveness.
- Security posture remains strong; firewall escape tests continue to report zero new escapes post v0.9.1 patch.
- Daily audits continue to surface missing safe-input GitHub query tools for performance summary workflows.
