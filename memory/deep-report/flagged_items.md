## Flagged Items for Monitoring (2026-01-21)

- MCP remote authentication test failures due to missing MCP toolsets in runtime (auth-test discussions on 2026-01-21).
- Missing safe-input GitHub query tools for Daily Project Performance Summary workflow; limits metrics coverage.
- High token usage per run in CI Cleaner and Agent Persona Explorer; optimization needed to reduce cost exposure.
- GitHub MCP tool response bloat (list_releases, list_code_scanning_alerts) creates context pressure for agents.
- Daily CLI Performance Agent lacks Go toolchain, triggering missing_tool reports.
