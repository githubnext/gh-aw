# Safe Output Messages Design System

This document catalogs all messages, footers, and UI patterns used across GitHub Agentic Workflows safe output functions.

## Overview

Safe output functions handle GitHub API write operations (creating issues, discussions, comments, PRs, etc.) from AI-generated content. They produce consistent, user-facing messages with:

- AI attribution footers
- Workflow installation instructions
- Related items references
- Staged mode preview messages
- Error and warning messages

## Message Categories

### 1. AI Attribution Footer

**Purpose**: Identifies content as AI-generated and links to the workflow run.

**Pattern**: Blockquote with workflow link and optional triggering context.

#### Basic Footer Format

**Markdown Source:**
```markdown
> AI generated by [WorkflowName](run_url)
```

**Rendered Output:**
> AI generated by [WorkflowName](https://github.com/example/repo/actions/runs/12345)

#### Footer with Triggering Context

**Markdown Source:**
```markdown
> AI generated by [WorkflowName](run_url) for #123
```

**Rendered Output:**
> AI generated by [Issue Analyzer](https://github.com/example/repo/actions/runs/12345) for #123

**Context Variations:**
- `for #N` - When triggered by an issue or pull request
- `for discussion #N` - When triggered by a discussion

### 2. Workflow Installation Instructions

**Purpose**: Provides command to add the workflow to user's repository.

**Pattern**: Multi-line blockquote with CLI command and documentation link.

**Markdown Source:**
```markdown
>
> To add this workflow in your repository, run `gh aw add owner/repo/path@ref`. See [usage guide](https://githubnext.github.io/gh-aw/tools/cli/).
```

**Rendered Output:**
>
> To add this workflow in your repository, run `gh aw add githubnext/gh-aw/.github/workflows/example@main`. See [usage guide](https://githubnext.github.io/gh-aw/tools/cli/).

**When shown**: Appears when workflow has a known source location.

### 3. Related Items References

**Purpose**: Links AI-generated comments to related issues, discussions, or pull requests created in the same workflow.

**Pattern**: Markdown heading with bulleted list of links.

**Markdown Source:**
```markdown
#### Related Items

- Issue: [#123](issue_url)
- Discussion: [#456](discussion_url)
- Pull Request: [#789](pr_url)
```

**Rendered Output:**

#### Related Items

- Issue: [#123](https://github.com/example/repo/issues/123)
- Discussion: [#456](https://github.com/example/repo/discussions/456)
- Pull Request: [#789](https://github.com/example/repo/pull/789)

**When shown**: Added to comments when the workflow creates multiple related items.

### 4. Staged Mode Preview Messages

**Purpose**: Show preview of safe output operations without executing them, for testing and validation.

**Pattern**: Step summary with ðŸŽ­ emoji header and detailed preview content.

#### Preview Header Pattern

All staged mode previews use this consistent format:

- Success Summary

**Key Features**:
- Selective field updates (status, title, body)
- Permission-based restrictions
- No AI footer (preserves existing content)

## Design Patterns

### Consistent Footer Format
All AI-generated content uses a blockquote footer format to clearly identify the source:
- Basic: `> AI generated by [WorkflowName](run_url)`
- With context: `> AI generated by [WorkflowName](run_url) for #123`

### Staged Mode Indicator
The ðŸŽ­ emoji consistently marks preview mode across all safe output types, making it easy to distinguish test runs from live operations.

### Visual Hierarchy
- Headers use `##` for main sections and `###` for subsections
- Bold text for field labels in previews
- Horizontal rules (`---`) separate multiple items
- Collapsible details for large content (patches)

### Link Patterns
- Issue links: `#123` or `[#123](url)`
- Pull request links: `#789` or `[#789](url)`
- Discussion links: `discussion #456` or `[#456](url)`
- Workflow runs: `[WorkflowName](run_url)`

### Content Safety
- Label text is sanitized to prevent @mentions
- Control characters are removed
- Patch sizes are limited to prevent overwhelming displays

## Design Principles

### Consistency
- All AI-generated content uses the same blockquote footer format
- ðŸŽ­ emoji consistently marks staged preview mode
- URL patterns match GitHub conventions
- Step summaries follow the same heading and list structure

### Clarity
- Clear distinction between preview and actual operations
- Explicit error messages with actionable guidance
- Helpful fallback instructions when operations fail
- Field labels consistently use bold text

### Discoverability
- Installation instructions included in footers when available
- Related items automatically linked across workflow outputs
- Step summaries provide quick access to created items
- Collapsible sections keep large content manageable

### Safety
- Labels are sanitized to prevent unintended @mentions
- Patch sizes are validated and truncated when needed
- Staged mode allows testing without side effects
- Graceful fallbacks when primary operations fail
