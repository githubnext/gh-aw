# CI Doctor Performance Analysis

## Performance Issues Identified

### 1. Tool Call Inefficiency
- **Issue**: CI Doctor has 40+ GitHub MCP tools available but uses a sequential investigation approach
- **Problem**: Each tool call has network latency, authentication overhead
- **Impact**: Longer execution times, higher costs

### 2. Redundant Tool Calls
- **Issue**: May make similar API calls multiple times during investigation phases
- **Problem**: No caching of GitHub API responses within a workflow run
- **Impact**: Unnecessary API rate limit usage, increased latency

### 3. Sanitization Overhead
- **Issue**: Complex sanitization in `sanitize_output.cjs` runs on every output
- **Problem**: 
  - Multiple regex passes on potentially large content
  - Domain filtering on every URL
  - @mention neutralization on every output
- **Impact**: CPU overhead, memory usage for large outputs

### 4. Log Analysis Bottlenecks
- **Issue**: Downloads and processes large log files sequentially
- **Problem**: No streaming or chunked processing for large CI logs
- **Impact**: Memory usage spikes, timeout risk

### 5. Memory Pattern Inefficiency
- **Issue**: Investigation memory stored in `/tmp/memory/` not optimized
- **Problem**: Linear search through investigation files, no indexing
- **Impact**: Slower pattern matching on large history

## Performance Improvement Opportunities

### 1. Tool Call Optimization
```markdown
# Optimize API calls by batching and caching
- Use `get_workflow_run` once and cache result
- Combine `list_workflow_jobs` with job details in single call
- Cache GitHub API responses within workflow run
```

### 2. Parallel Investigation
```markdown
# Split investigation into parallel phases
- Run log analysis and historical search concurrently
- Use GitHub GraphQL for batched queries
- Parallelize pattern matching across investigation files
```

### 3. Sanitization Optimization
```javascript
// Optimize sanitization with single-pass processing
function optimizedSanitizeContent(content) {
  // Single regex pass with combined patterns
  // Lazy loading of domain lists
  // Early exit for small content
}
```

### 4. Smart Pattern Matching
```markdown
# Implement smart investigation indexing
- Create fingerprints of error patterns
- Use hash-based lookup for similar failures
- Maintain lightweight metadata index
```

### 5. Streaming Log Analysis
```markdown
# Process logs in chunks to reduce memory usage
- Stream large log files instead of loading entirely
- Process log lines incrementally
- Exit early on pattern matches
```

## Tool Usage Analysis

Based on the CI Doctor workflow configuration:

### High-Frequency Tools (Performance Critical)
1. `get_workflow_run` - Used in every run
2. `list_workflow_jobs` - Used in every run  
3. `get_job_logs` - Downloads potentially large files
4. `search_issues` - Used for duplicate detection
5. `get_issue_comments` - Used for historical analysis

### Medium-Frequency Tools
1. `get_commit` - For commit analysis
2. `get_pull_request` - For PR context
3. `list_workflow_runs` - For historical patterns

### Low-Frequency Tools
1. Issue creation tools - Only on new problems
2. File content tools - Only for specific analysis

## Recommended Optimizations

### Phase 1: Quick Wins
1. **Cache API responses** within workflow run
2. **Optimize sanitization** with single-pass processing
3. **Add early exit conditions** for known patterns
4. **Batch GitHub API calls** where possible

### Phase 2: Architectural Improvements
1. **Implement investigation fingerprinting** for fast lookups
2. **Add streaming log processing** for large files
3. **Create parallel investigation tracks**
4. **Optimize memory pattern storage** with indexing

### Phase 3: Advanced Optimizations
1. **Use GitHub GraphQL** for batched queries
2. **Implement smart caching** across workflow runs
3. **Add predictive pattern matching** based on commit changes
4. **Create specialized investigation modes** (quick vs deep)

## Performance Metrics to Track

1. **Tool Call Count** per investigation
2. **Total API Calls** and rate limit usage  
3. **Memory Usage** during log processing
4. **Investigation Duration** by failure type
5. **Cache Hit Rate** for similar failures
6. **Sanitization Processing Time** 
7. **Pattern Matching Speed**

## Cost Optimization

1. **Token Usage**: Optimize prompt length and tool descriptions
2. **API Calls**: Reduce redundant GitHub API requests
3. **Processing Time**: Minimize CPU-intensive operations
4. **Memory**: Stream large files instead of loading entirely
