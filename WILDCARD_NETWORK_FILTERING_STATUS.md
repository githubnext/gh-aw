# Wildcard Network Filtering Implementation Status

## Summary

This document provides a comprehensive analysis of wildcard network filtering support in GitHub Agentic Workflows.

## Current Implementation Status

### ✅ Claude Engine - FULLY IMPLEMENTED

Wildcard patterns are **fully implemented and tested** for the Claude engine via Python network permission hooks.

**Implementation Details:**
- **File**: `pkg/workflow/engine_network_hooks.go` (lines 61-75)
- **Pattern Conversion**: `pattern.replace('.', r'\.').replace('*', '.*')`
- **Matching Logic**: `re.match(f'^{regex}$', domain)`
- **Test Coverage**: `TestWildcardNetworkPermissionsClaudeEngine`

**Verified Behavior:**
- ✅ `*.example.com` matches `api.example.com` (single-level subdomain)
- ✅ `*.example.com` matches `nested.api.example.com` (multi-level subdomain)
- ✅ `*.example.com` does NOT match `example.com` (base domain)
- ✅ `*.example.com` does NOT match `notexample.com` (partial suffix)

### ⚠️ Copilot Engine with AWF - PARTIALLY VERIFIED

Wildcard patterns are **passed to AWF** via the `--allow-domains` flag, but the external AWF binary's wildcard support has not been independently verified.

**Implementation Details:**
- **File**: `pkg/workflow/copilot_engine.go` (line 218)
- **AWF Invocation**: `--allow-domains '*.example.com,api.github.com,...'`
- **Domain List Building**: `GetCopilotAllowedDomains()` in `pkg/workflow/domains.go`
- **Test Coverage**: `TestWildcardNetworkPermissionsCopilotEngine`

**What is Verified:**
- ✅ Wildcards are correctly extracted from workflow configuration
- ✅ Wildcards are included in the comma-separated domain list
- ✅ Wildcards are passed to AWF via `--allow-domains` flag

**What is NOT Verified:**
- ❓ AWF binary's actual wildcard matching implementation
- ❓ AWF's wildcard syntax compatibility (if different from `*.domain.com`)
- ❓ AWF's behavior when given wildcard patterns

**AWF Source:**
- Repository: `github.com/githubnext/gh-aw-firewall`
- Binary: Downloaded from GitHub releases
- Version: Configurable via `network.firewall.version`

## Security Guide Accuracy

The security guide (`docs/src/content/docs/guides/security.md` line 496) states:

> **Use Wildcards Carefully**: `*.example.com` matches any subdomain including nested ones (e.g., `api.example.com`, `nested.api.example.com`) - ensure this broad access is intended

**Assessment:**
- ✅ **Accurate for Claude engine** - behavior verified via tests
- ⚠️ **Assumed for Copilot/AWF** - wildcards are passed to AWF, but AWF's implementation is external

## Recommendations

### For Claude Engine Users
No action needed. Wildcard filtering is fully functional and tested.

### For Copilot Engine Users
The gh-aw codebase correctly passes wildcards to AWF. However, if you need to verify AWF's wildcard support:

1. **Check AWF Documentation**: Review `github.com/githubnext/gh-aw-firewall` documentation
2. **Test with AWF Directly**: Run AWF with wildcard patterns and verify behavior
3. **Review AWF Source**: Examine AWF's domain matching implementation
4. **Check AWF Logs**: AWF logs network activity, which can confirm wildcard matching

### For Security Guide
Consider adding a note distinguishing between:
- **Claude engine**: Native wildcard support via Python hooks
- **Copilot engine**: Wildcards passed to AWF (external binary)

Example addition:
```markdown
**Note**: For Claude engine, wildcard matching is implemented directly in the workflow.
For Copilot engine with AWF, wildcards are passed to the AWF binary via `--allow-domains`.
Verify AWF's wildcard support in the [gh-aw-firewall repository](https://github.com/githubnext/gh-aw-firewall).
```

## Test Coverage

All verification tests pass successfully:

```bash
$ go test -v -run TestWildcard ./pkg/workflow/...
=== RUN   TestWildcardNetworkPermissionsClaudeEngine
--- PASS: TestWildcardNetworkPermissionsClaudeEngine (0.01s)
=== RUN   TestWildcardNetworkPermissionsCopilotEngine
--- PASS: TestWildcardNetworkPermissionsCopilotEngine (0.00s)
=== RUN   TestWildcardDomainMatching
--- PASS: TestWildcardDomainMatching (0.00s)
=== RUN   TestWildcardSecurityGuideAccuracy
--- PASS: TestWildcardSecurityGuideAccuracy (0.00s)
PASS
```

## Conclusion

**For the gh-aw codebase**: Wildcard network filtering is properly implemented for Claude engine and correctly configured for Copilot/AWF.

**For end-to-end wildcard support**: Claude engine is fully verified. Copilot/AWF requires verification of the external AWF binary's wildcard matching implementation.

**For the security guide**: The documentation is accurate for Claude engine. For Copilot/AWF, it assumes AWF supports wildcards (which should be verified separately).
