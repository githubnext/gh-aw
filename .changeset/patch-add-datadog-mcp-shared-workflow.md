Add Datadog MCP shared workflow configuration

Adds a new shared Datadog MCP server configuration at `.github/workflows/shared/mcp/datadog.md` that enables agentic workflows to interact with Datadog's observability and monitoring platform. The configuration provides 10 tools for comprehensive Datadog access including monitors, dashboards, metrics, logs, events, and incidents with container-based deployment and multi-region support.
