Update tool call rendering to include duration and token size

Enhanced log parsers for Claude, Codex, and Copilot to display execution duration and approximate token counts for tool calls. Adds helper functions for token estimation (using chars/token formula) and human-readable duration formatting to provide better visibility into tool execution performance and resource usage.
