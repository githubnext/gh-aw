"gh-aw": patch
---

Fix `gh.md` to explicitly reference the `safeinputs-gh` tool name instead of the
ambiguous "gh" safe-input tool; update prompt text and examples to use
`safeinputs-gh` consistently.

This patch updates documentation and smoke workflow prompts to avoid
confusion between the `gh` CLI and the MCP tool named `safeinputs-gh`.
