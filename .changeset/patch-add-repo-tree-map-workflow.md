Add repo-tree-map workflow for visualizing repository structure

This introduces a new agentic workflow that generates an ASCII tree map visualization of the repository file structure and publishes it as a GitHub Discussion. The workflow uses bash tools to gather repository statistics and create a formatted report with directory hierarchy, file size distributions, and repository metadata.
