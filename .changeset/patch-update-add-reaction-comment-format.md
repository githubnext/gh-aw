Update comment message format for add_reaction job

The message format in the add_reaction_and_edit_comment.cjs script has been updated to remove blockquote prefixes and use the actual workflow name instead of generic "workflow run" text. This provides cleaner, more informative comments when agentic workflows are triggered.
