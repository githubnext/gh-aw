Merge "Create prompt" and "Print prompt to step summary" workflow steps

Consolidates the prompt generation workflow by moving the "Print prompt to step summary" step to appear immediately after prompt creation, making the workflow more logical and easier to understand. The functionality remains identical - this is purely a reorganization for better code structure.
