Add Sentry MCP Integration for Agentic Workflows (Read-Only)

Adds comprehensive Sentry MCP integration to enable agentic workflows to interact with Sentry for application monitoring and debugging. The integration provides 14 read-only Sentry tools including organization/project management, release management, issue/event analysis, AI-powered search, and documentation access. Configuration is available as a shared MCP setup at `.github/workflows/shared/mcp/sentry.md` that can be imported into any workflow for safe, non-destructive monitoring operations.
