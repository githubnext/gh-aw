Add comprehensive logging to validate_errors.cjs for infinite loop detection

Added debugging capabilities to the validate_errors.cjs script including timeout protection, iteration counting with warnings, and detailed logging to detect and prevent potential infinite loops. Changed the script start message to use core.debug instead of core.info for consistency with debug-level logging.
