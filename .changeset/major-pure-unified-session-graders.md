Run graders as pure computation over the redacted in-memory unified session in
conclusion, with ten fast built-ins enabled by default.

Custom JavaScript runs only in a separate restricted job after conclusion,
receiving immutable in-memory session data and lookup helpers. Conclusion never
receives executable custom definitions. Audit conditionally downloads the
combined `graders` results artifact when custom IDs are registered, including
when refreshing cached reports. The logs `graders` artifact set includes both jobs'
results, including workflow-call-prefixed names and cached usage-only downloads.

**Breaking change:** Bash/file-based graders, `operational-value`, and `run`
are rejected. Remove these entries or migrate to pure JavaScript with a distinct
custom ID and the `session, config, helpers` contract. User-provided conclusion
steps are rejected; move them to a separate job.
Expensive trajectory analyses now require explicit opt-in.

Grader artifacts use schema version 2 and live in `usage/graders/`, not the
agent artifact; custom results use the separate `graders` artifact. Recompile
workflows to adopt the split jobs. For
`gh aw graders run`, replace legacy trace payloads with unified-session JSONL
or a JSON event array; run-ID replay downloads the `usage` session.
