Run graders as pure computation over the redacted in-memory unified session in
conclusion, with ten fast built-ins enabled by default.

Custom JavaScript runs only in a separate restricted job after conclusion,
receiving immutable in-memory session data and lookup helpers. Conclusion never
receives executable custom definitions. Audit conditionally downloads the
combined `graders` results artifact when custom IDs are registered, including
when refreshing cached reports. The logs `graders` artifact set includes both jobs'
results, including workflow-call-prefixed names and cached usage-only downloads.

Repository-owned `graders.operational-value.run` Bash executes only in that
separate job. Refactor evaluators to read unified-session JSONL from `$1` /
`GH_AW_SESSION_FILE` and configuration from `GH_AW_GRADER_CONFIG`; retain the
legacy metric-array output. Bash AST validation and `grader-shell-file-write`
reject detected file writes. This is trusted shell compatibility, not a
microVM or filesystem/network sandbox.

**Breaking change:** Legacy evaluator stdin requests and built-in overrides
are rejected. Other custom IDs use pure JavaScript and the
`session, config, helpers` contract. User-provided conclusion
steps are rejected; move them to a separate job.
Expensive trajectory analyses now require explicit opt-in.

Grader artifacts use schema version 2 and live in `usage/graders/`, not the
agent artifact; custom results use the separate `graders` artifact. Recompile
workflows to adopt the split jobs. For
`gh aw graders run`, replace legacy trace payloads with unified-session JSONL
or a JSON event array; run-ID replay downloads the `usage` session.
