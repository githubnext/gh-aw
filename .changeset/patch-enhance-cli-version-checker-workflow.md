Enhance CLI version checker workflow with comprehensive version analysis

Enhanced the CLI version checker workflow to perform deeper research summaries when updates are detected. The workflow now includes:

- Version-by-version analysis for all intermediate versions
- Categorized change tracking (breaking changes, features, bugs, security, performance)
- Impact assessment on gh-aw workflows
- Timeline analysis with release dates
- Risk assessment (Low/Medium/High)
- Enhanced research sources and methods documentation
- Improved PR description templates with comprehensive version progression documentation

This internal tooling improvement helps maintainers make more informed decisions about CLI dependency updates.
