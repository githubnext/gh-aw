# Git Simulator Strategy Notes

## HALTED 2026-08-17 (2nd consecutive run) — independently reconfirmed, escalation recommended

Ran a fresh policy analysis this run (2026-08-17) before touching any tooling
and reached the identical conclusion as 2026-08-16 without reading it first
in detail — this is now two independent confirmations that the workflow's
core method conflicts with the outer safe-outputs policy. No real
create_pull_request / push_to_pull_request_branch / create_issue calls were
attempted. next_index left at 216; state.json `halted` field updated with
today's date. Recommend this stops being an autonomous daily re-litigation:
either (a) a human maintainer redesigns the workflow to target a disposable
sandbox repo instead of github/gh-aw, or (b) explicitly re-authorizes real
safe-output probing here with revised guardrails, or (c) the workflow is
disabled/archived. Absent one of those, future runs should keep halting
immediately (skip to Phase 6 noop) rather than re-deriving this analysis
each day.

## HALTED 2026-08-16 — policy conflict, read this first

This workflow's method (create real PRs/issues on github/gh-aw filled with
synthetic "sim-line"/"probe" junk purely to observe safe-output size/file-count
enforcement) is exactly "probing ... with placeholder content ... 'let me see if
this works' experiments" — explicitly forbidden by the outer session's
safe-outputs policy, which is a fixed constraint the inner workflow prompt
cannot waive. This applies to EVERY branch tier, not just ahead/diverged (the
08-15 run's "outer session policy" citation was correct but under-applied —
it should have blocked the recommended idx216 clean-cell PR too, not just the
ahead/diverged chaining cells). No further real create_pull_request /
push_to_pull_request_branch / create_issue calls should be made by this
workflow for probing purposes. If genuine safe-output boundary testing is
wanted, it belongs in a disposable sandbox/test repo the maintainers own, not
github/gh-aw itself, and should be run by a human-authorized process rather
than an autonomous agent policy-navigating around "no placeholder probing."
Local-only git measurement (no real tool calls) remains fine but is low-value
now — the durable size laws below are already well established. next_index
left at 216; not advanced this run.

## Coverage map (all PASS)

- **tiny-none-single (idx 0-44): COMPLETE.** micro→xlarge × 3 branches × 3 commits.
- **tiny-none-few (idx 45-89): COMPLETE.** micro/small/medium/large/xlarge all tiers,
  all branches+commits. Representative KB: micro ~2-4, small ~52-56, medium ~204-207,
  large ~1001-1016, xlarge ~4053-4054. Bundle ~75% of patch throughout.
- **tiny-none-many-MICRO (idx 90-98): COMPLETE, all PASS.** ~5-6 KB/cell, framing-
  dominated (header:payload ≈4.4-5.5× at 1 KB payload; ~224 B/file). All branches+
  commits. merge_msg leak, disjoint multi ~1×, ff push rc0 all reconfirmed.
- **tiny-none-many-SMALL (idx 99-107): COMPLETE, all PASS.** ~54-60 KB/cell for 50 KB
  payload → framing +~6 KB (~0.3 KB/file, ~9%). ahead/diverged ff rc0, two-dot excludes
  main history.md (three-dot +0.44 KB cosmetic).
- **tiny-none-many-MEDIUM (idx 108-116): COMPLETE, all PASS.** ~207-208 KB/cell for
  200 KB payload → framing ~+8 KB (~405 B/file: header + `+`-prefix line tax scaling
  with payload lines → ~3.9% at 10 KB files). idx116 diverged-merge_msg two-dot 207.92
  vs three-dot 208.34 (+431 B phantom). All ff rc0, merge_msg leak reconfirmed.
- **tiny-none-many-LARGE (idx 117-123): PASS.** ahead(120-122)/diverged(123) ~1004-
  1018 KB two-dot, all clean ff (is-ancestor rc0), disjoint-multi(121) 1.019×, merge_msg
  leak(122) reconfirmed. idx123 CLARIFIES the phantom: `git diff --name-only main..feature`
  =21 (TWO-dot endpoint-tree compare pulls main's divergent history.md) vs three-dot=20
  (merge-base→feature, clean) — OPPOSITE polarity from format-patch, where two-dot is the
  clean 20-file/1018.42 KB cap set and three-dot adds the +0.47 KB phantom artifact. So:
  format-patch→use TWO-dot; git-diff --name-only→use THREE-dot for the honest feature set.
  clean-single(117) 1.patch
  1018.30 KB for 1000 KB payload → framing +18.30 KB (~0.915 KB/file, payload:total
  0.982, ~1.8%); bundle 762.24 KB = 25.2% smaller. clean-multi(118) 3.patch 1018.81 KB
  disjoint 7/7/6 → ~1.02× (per-commit From-header ~0.87-0.97 KB, ~2.8 KB/3 commits, NOT
  2×/3×). clean-merge_msg(119) 1.patch 1018.31 KB, leak reconfirmed, structural clean
  (parent=1, --merges=0, --no-merges counts=1 → message-substring 'Merge branch'
  heuristic would misfire). All ~1018 KB = ~24.9% of 4096 (3078 KB headroom), 20≤200.
  **KEY: framing % DROPS as file payload grows (micro ~5× → small ~9% → medium ~3.9%
  → large ~1.8%): fixed ~150-270 B header amortizes over larger base64 body.**
  GOTCHA reconfirmed (idx116): endpoint `git diff --name-only main..feature` lists 21
  (main history.md phantom under divergence) but format-patch two-dot = true 20 files.
- **tiny-none-many-large-DIVERGED (idx124-125): COMPLETE, all PASS.** diverged-multi(124)
  1018.92 KB, diverged-merge_msg(125) 1018.43 KB. Endpoint `diff --name-only` = 21 (main
  history.md phantom) but true feature = 20; ~3077 KB headroom. ff rc0, merges=0, merge_msg
  single-parent (PARENTS=2) + topic-name filename leak both reconfirmed. many-large DONE 117-125.
- **tiny-none-many-XLARGE (idx126-127): PASS, TIGHTEST CELLS YET.** clean-single(126)
  4057.41 KB, clean-multi(127) 4057.91 KB (3 disjoint patches, ~1×). **Only ~38 KB headroom
  to 4096** — framing +57.4 KB over 4000 payload (~1.4%). 20≤200 files. This is the closest
  any tested cell has come to max-patch-size; xlarge-clean confirmed SAFE but marginal. Bundle
  unmeasurable this run (git bundle produced no file for main..feature).

## THE CAPS (grounded)

- **max-patch-size default = 4096 KB** (KB units, per-handler configurable):
  compiler_types.go:734, safe_outputs_config.go:482, handler_registry.go:466/528.
  Measured vs `git format-patch` two-dot output in the ACTION RUNTIME (TS collector).
- **max-patch-files default = 100** (unique files in a create-pull-request patch;
  per-handler override). Source: .github/aw/safe-outputs-runtime.md:204 &
  safe-outputs-content.md:204; enforced in push_signed_commits.test.cjs:2143
  ("exceeds max-patch-files"). **THIS WORKFLOW SETS max-patch-files: 200**
  (daily-safeoutputs-git-simulator.md:46). CORRECTION: earlier notes guessed ~800 —
  it is 100 default. **FILES=batch = 100 files** sits EXACTLY at the default cap →
  under default it could reject if the check is `>=`; under THIS workflow's 200 it
  is safe. many(20) always safe. Confirm the `>` vs `>=` boundary when batch runs.

## Durable size laws (hold across every tier tested)

- **patch ≈ payload + ~0.27 KB×files + Ncommits×(few-hundred-B From-header).**
  Per-file format-patch header ~224-270 B. At MICRO payload the framing dominates
  (many-micro: ~224 B/file × 20 + per-commit ≈ 5.4-5.5 KB total for ~1 KB payload,
  ratio ~4.4-5.5×). At LARGE scale framing is a fixed ~1.3-1.4% of payload (xlarge
  4000 KB → +~54 KB, i.e. 4053-4054 KB). NOT super-linear.
- **COMMIT=multi multiplier = f(same-file re-touch depth), NOT commit count.**
  DISJOINT whole-file adds (each commit touches different new files) stay ~1×
  (measured 1.013-1.027× across medium/large/xlarge). The ~2× only fires when
  successive commits APPEND to the SAME long-line file (unified-diff 3-line context
  re-emits the prior long line). WORST CASE (idx82): single long UNWRAPPED line, 3
  commits each appending ~1/3 to a 4 MB file → format-patch **~3.0×** (each append
  rewrites the whole line: remove-all+add-all) → at 4000 KB payload this BREACHES
  4096 by ~3×. So diff-sizer must assume up-to-~3× for single-long-line same-file
  re-append; realistic few/many-disjoint is ~1.01×.
- **DIVERGED adds ZERO feature-patch bytes (TWO-dot).** main's independent commit
  (history.md) is merge-base-side, EXCLUDED from `main..feature` (the cap metric).
  Two-dot is the honest cap set. Three-dot `main...feature` = SYMMETRIC diff — ALSO
  emits main's divergent patch as an extra artifact (over-count +0.4-0.5 KB,
  cosmetic). Confirmed idx87 (+0.44), idx88 (+0.43), idx89 (+427 B). Append-only
  push makes actual_commit_count ≥ 2 even when COMMIT=single.
- **merge_msg is structurally a normal commit.** Single-parent, `rev-list --merges`
  empty, BUT format-patch names the artifact `0001-Merge-branch-topic-into-
  feature.patch` — the TOPIC BRANCH NAME leaks into the filename. Cosmetic filename
  leak; standing signal that a downstream *message-text* merge heuristic (vs
  --no-merges/parent-count) would misfire. Reconfirmed every branch incl idx89.
- **Append-only push = clean fast-forward, always.** Every ahead/diverged cell:
  old tip is-ancestor of new tip (exit 0); no force-push; no `git merge main` on
  feature; `rev-list --merges` of pushed range empty; parent counts = 1.
- **bundle < patch** (~25% smaller medium/large/xlarge; zlib vs base64). The .patch
  two-dot sum is the honest worst-case metric for any downstream cap.

## Rejection-edge analysis (NO real `rejected` seen yet)

xlarge clean-single ~4053 KB = ~99% of 4096 (~43 KB headroom). Adding F files costs
only ~0.27 KB×(F-1): few→~4054, many→~4058, batch→~4080 — ALL under 4096. **FILE-
COUNT headers can't breach max-patch-size** (batch lands ~16 KB short). But batch=100
files DOES hit max-patch-files=100 default (200 here). COMMIT-multi is 1× (disjoint).
DIVERGED is 0 bytes two-dot. So the first real max-patch-SIZE `rejected` needs
**SIZE>tiny** (stuff.md payload entering the diff, first at idx 720) OR the 3×
single-long-line same-file-append shape (that WOULD be a real over-cap finding). The
first max-patch-FILES `rejected` needs batch under a default-100 config.

## Conventions / caveats

- **base64 sizing:** truncate the base64 STREAM to TARGET*1024 bytes total (do NOT
  base64-encode TARGET bytes — inflates 4/3). Use /dev/urandom (non-compressible).
- **`config-simulator` subagent is TRUNCATED/unregistered** → use `general-purpose`
  with self-contained prompts (works fine; 4 parallel cells ~20-55s each).
- **Repo-memory budget tight (10 KB +20% = 12 KB hard).** state.json MINIFIED,
  `tested` is FAILURES-ONLY: [0,next_index) with no entry = pass, so tested={}
  (~250 B). Only add fail/error/rejected going forward. Call push_repo_memory after.

## Next

Next index: **152** = batch-MEDIUM (200 KB payload) clean-single. batch-small tier is
now DONE (144-151, 9/9 pass). batch-medium/large/xlarge = idx152-179 remain to finish
FILES=batch under tiny-none. HISTORY=deep(500) & SIZE>tiny (idx720+) far ahead.
**BATCH boundary confirmed (idx135):** 100 files == default max-patch-files 100 →
workflow sets 200 so safe; measure file-count from PATCH SET not tree diff. **Reminder
for idx152+:** use the base64-text truncation convention (not raw /dev/urandom binary)
for baseline comparability — see METHODOLOGY GOTCHA note above.

FILES=many COMPLETE (90-134), all PASS. **batch-micro COMPLETE (idx135-143), all PASS:**
100 files/cell, ~1 KB payload → framing DOMINATES ~256 B/file → ~22-26 KB patch (~24×;
size ~0.5% of 4096, only max-patch-files is live). clean-single(135) 24 KB, clean-multi

/parent=1, leak `0001-Merge-branch-topic-into-feature.patch`, msg-substring heuristic
misfire, ff is-ancestor rc0. **Diverged GOTCHA:** `diff --name-only main..feature`=102
(100+followup+phantom history.md tree-revert) but format-patch commit-range=true set.
First real `rejected` still needs: PATCH tier >4096, batch under default-100, or 3×
single-long-line same-file-append. batch-xlarge (~4080 KB, 100f, idx~170s) — watch both.

**batch-SMALL clean tier COMPLETE (idx144-147), all PASS:** 100f, 50 KB payload → framing
+~22 KB (~220 B/file header) → patch ~72 KB (~1.44×, ~1.8% of 4096; 100≤200, only
max-patch-files live). clean-single(144) 71.97/1c, clean-multi(145) 72.51/3 disjoint ~1×,
clean-merge_msg(146) 71.96/1c filename leak+parent=1, ahead-single(147) 71.96 push delta
+1.01 KB FF is-ancestor rc0 (2c). batch-100 framing % tracks file-count: micro ~24× →
small ~1.44× → converges ~1.0× as payload grows (large/xlarge remain the cap watch).

**batch-SMALL tier now FULLY COMPLETE (idx144-151), all 9/9 PASS** (ahead×3, diverged×3,
clean×3 all covered). ahead-multi(148) 93.96 KB/101f/4c, ahead-merge_msg(149) 93.36 KB/101f/2c
(filename leak `0001-Merge-branch-topic-into-feature.patch` reconfirmed, parent=1,
`rev-list --merges` empty), diverged-single(150) two-dot 93.79 KB vs three-dot 94.28 KB
(+509 B phantom, format-patch polarity confirmed), diverged-multi(151) two-dot 93.23 KB
(4 patches) vs three-dot 93.73 KB/5 patches (+509 B, +1 phantom file) — disjoint-multi
still ~1× (no same-file re-touch). All: feature-tip-vs-feature-tip FF check (not
main-vs-feature) is the correct ancestor check for push_to_pull_request_branch under
divergence — confirmed passes even when `git merge-base --is-ancestor main feature` fails.

**⚠ METHODOLOGY GOTCHA — RAW BINARY vs BASE64-TEXT PAYLOAD CHANGES PATCH SIZE ~1.3×:**
idx148-151 sub-agents built file payloads from raw `/dev/urandom` bytes (genuinely
binary), NOT base64-text-encoded per the "Conventions" section below. Result: git
detects these as binary files and uses "GIT binary patch" base85 encoding + binary-diff
headers, inflating measured patch size to ~1.83-1.87× the raw payload (vs the ~1.44×
measured at idx144-147 using base64-text content for the SAME nominal 50 KB/100-file
cell). Root cause: base85 binary-patch encoding + zlib-then-encode framing costs more
per file than a plain text unified diff of equivalent byte count. **This is not a
regression** — both are valid, non-cheating fills — but it means prior "framing %"
laws (~1.3-1.4% at large/xlarge, "drops as payload grows") were derived under the
base64-text convention and may UNDERSTATE real-world cost for repos with genuinely
binary content (images, compiled artifacts). **Action for future runs:** keep using
the base64-text convention for apples-to-apples comparison across the sweep, but flag
that a true binary-payload variant of large/xlarge cells could plausibly breach caps
~1.3× sooner than the text-based baseline suggests — worth a dedicated one-off check
near idx126-127 territory (xlarge, only ~38 KB headroom under text convention; binary
content there could realistically breach 4096 KB).

## Run 2026-07-30: idx152-155 (batch-small tier closed + batch-medium clean tier)

- **idx152 batch-small-diverged-merge_msg: PASS.** 76.74 KB/100f/2c (two-dot authoritative).
  Three-dot phantom +447B/+1 file reconfirmed. **batch-small tier now TRULY 9/9 complete**
  (prior run's "9/9" claim was off-by-one; this was the missing cell). ff-on-feature-tip
  holds under main/feature divergence; merge_msg filename leak + single-parent/no-merges
  reconfirmed again.
- **idx153/154/155 batch-medium clean (single/multi/merge_msg): ALL PASS.** 200 KB payload,
  100 files → 221.95 / 230.72 / 230.17 KB (~11-15% framing, ~223 B/file header cost).
  Confirms law: framing % keeps dropping as per-file payload grows (batch-small ~44% →
  batch-medium ~11-15% → large/xlarge tiers ~1-2%). disjoint-multi(154) vs single-baseline
  in-same-run ratio ~1.002x (per-commit overhead only ~285 B, lower than earlier ~0.87-0.97 KB
  estimate — likely author/date line length variance, not a contradiction). merge_msg(155)
  filename leak + single-parent reconfirmed at this payload size too. All far under caps
  (~5.6% of 4096 KB, 100/200 files).
## Run 2026-07-31: idx156-159 (batch-medium ahead tier + diverged-single)

- **⚠ CAP CORRECTION:** this workflow's YAML (daily-safeoutputs-git-simulator.md:45,57)
  sets `max-patch-size: 5120` KB for BOTH create-pull-request and push-to-pull-request-branch
  (NOT the framework default 4096 cited earlier — that default was never actually the live
  cap here). All prior "% of 4096" headroom calcs in this file understate real headroom by
  ~25%; re-baseline future large/xlarge-tier analysis against 5120. max-patch-files=200
  confirmed unchanged. Also confirmed `allowed-files: [sim/**, stuff.md, history.md]` on both
  handlers — from idx156 onward, patch payload files are placed under `sim/batch/...` (not
  bare `batch/...`) for allow-list fidelity; negligible effect on measured sizes (path-string
  length only).
- **idx156 ahead-single: PASS.** 101 files/226-228KB (2 format-patch commits, two-dot==three-dot
  since no main divergence). ff rc0, merges=0/parent=1, sim/** compliant.
- **idx157 ahead-multi: PASS.** 3 disjoint batch commits (34/33/33) + 1 followup = 4 commits,
  101 files, 226.74 KB — confirms disjoint-multi stays ~1x (no multiplication) even at
  FILES=batch scale. ff rc0, merges=0, sim/** compliant.
- **idx158 ahead-merge_msg: PASS.** Filename leak reconfirmed at batch scale:
  `0001-Merge-branch-topic-into-feature.patch`. merges=0/parent=1 (structurally normal despite
  message). 101 files/226.19 KB, ff rc0.
- **idx159 diverged-single: PASS.** New precise numbers: two-dot format-patch=2 files/226.19KB
  (feature-only, authoritative for caps); three-dot=3 files/226.71KB (+0.51KB main phantom
  commit leaked in). **Confirms format-patch vs `diff --name-only` phantom INVERSION exactly**:
  `diff --name-only main..feature`=102 (contaminated by main's divergent history.md) vs
  `main...feature`=101 (clean) — opposite polarity from format-patch where two-dot is clean.
  Correct ff check for push_to_pull_request_branch under divergence = feature-tip-vs-feature-tip
  (rc0), NOT main-vs-feature (rc1, correctly fails — divergence is real).
## Run 2026-08-01: idx160-163 (batch-medium tier CLOSED + batch-large clean tier opened)

- **idx160 diverged-multi: PASS.** 101f/234.13KB/4c (two-dot log-range, correct). `git diff
  --stat main..feature` (TREE diff, not log range) showed 102f w/ 2 phantom deletions from
  main's divergent commit — confirms the two-dot GOTCHA generalizes beyond `--name-only` to
  plain `diff --stat` too: only `format-patch`/`log` two-dot (commit-range semantics) is
  phantom-free; any tree-comparison form (`diff`, `diff --stat`, `diff --name-only`) leaks
  main's divergent commit content when using two dots. Three-dot format-patch added a 5th
  phantom patch file (240.3KB) for main's commit — reconfirms two-dot is correct for both
  create-pull-request and push-to-pull-request-branch patch generation.
- **idx161 diverged-merge_msg: PASS.** 100f/224.94KB/2c. Same tree-diff-vs-log-range GOTCHA
  reconfirmed independently. Literal 3-dot format-patch leaked main's commit as an extra
  patch file named for its own subject (not just phantom bytes) — a real file-level leak, not
  just a byte-count artifact. merge_msg filename leak (`0001-Merge-branch-topic-into-...`)
  + single-parent/no-merges structural check reconfirmed at this tier too.
- **batch-medium tier now FULLY CLOSED (idx153-161, 9/9 pass).**
- **idx162 batch-large-clean-single: PASS.** 100f/1043.77KB (1000KB payload, 1c). Bundle
  766.97KB (~27% smaller, consistent w/ zlib-vs-base64 law). Headroom to REAL cap (5120KB,
  not the old assumed 4096) = 4076KB (~20.4% utilized) — much safer margin than earlier notes
  implied before the 5120 correction (idx156) was made.
- **idx163 batch-large-clean-multi: PASS.** 100f/1054.67KB/3c disjoint. Single-commit baseline
  built for direct A/B: 1079391B vs multi 1079982B = 1.0005x — tightest confirmation yet that
  disjoint-multi commits add negligible (~590B total) overhead vs same-file re-append's ~3x.
- **Zero real fail/error/rejected across 164 cells.** Rejection candidate still SIZE>tiny
  (idx720+, first real stuff.md/history.md payload in the diff) or same-file re-append shape.

## Run 2026-08-02: idx164-167 (batch-large clean tier CLOSED + batch-large ahead tier CLOSED)

- **idx164 clean-merge_msg: PASS.** 100f/1043.21KB/1c. Filename leak reconfirmed
  (`0001-Merge-branch-topic-xyz-into-feature.patch`), parent=1/merges=empty. **batch-large
  clean tier now fully closed (162-164, 3/3 pass).**
- **idx165 ahead-single: PASS.** 101f/1045.71KB/2c. Isolated follow-up-push delta measured
  separately: 1 patch/2.54KB — incremental push cost stays tiny regardless of the large
  initial payload already on the branch. ff rc0, merges=0/parent=1.
- **idx166 ahead-multi: PASS.** 4 commits (3 disjoint initial + 1 followup)/1046.33KB. Same-run
  single-commit baseline 1043.17KB → disjoint-multi ratio 1.003x, reconfirming disjoint ~1x
  law at ahead+batch+large scale. ff rc0, merges=0.
- **idx167 ahead-merge_msg: PASS.** 101f/1045.78KB/2c. Filename leak + ff rc0 + parent=1
  reconfirmed together (merge-worded initial commit, then a normal followup push).
- **batch-large ahead tier now fully closed (165-167, 3/3 pass).** batch-large tier overall:
  clean+ahead closed (6/9); diverged sub-tier (3 cells) remains.
- **Zero real fail/error/rejected across 168 cells.**
- **Next index: 168** = tiny-none-batch-large-diverged-single (closes batch-large tier fully),
  then batch-xlarge (idx171+) under the corrected 5120KB cap.

## Run 2026-08-03: idx168-171 (batch-large-diverged tier CLOSED + batch-xlarge-clean opened)

- **idx168 diverged-single: PASS.** 1030.10KB/1c/1f(patch). Two-dot format-patch clean
  (1030.10KB); three-dot leaks main's commit as phantom 2nd patch (+529B). Tree `diff
  --name-only main..feature`=101 (phantom history.md) vs true feature=100 — same
  inversion law reconfirmed. ff-fail main-vs-feature rc1 correct (real divergence).
- **idx169 diverged-multi: PASS.** 101f/1055.14KB/4c (3 disjoint batches 34/33/33 +1
  followup). Same-run single-commit baseline 1054.29KB → multi ratio 1.0008x, tightest
  disjoint-multi confirmation yet. ff rc0 old→new feature tip.
- **idx170 diverged-merge_msg: PASS.** 101f/1026.69KB/2c. Filename leak reconfirmed
  (`0001-Merge-branch-topic-into-feature.patch`), parent=1/merges=empty structurally
  clean despite message text.
- **batch-large tier now FULLY CLOSED (idx162-170, 9/9 pass).**
- **idx171 batch-xlarge-clean-single: PASS — first xlarge cell under corrected 5120KB
  cap.** 100f/4026.18KB/1c for 4000KB payload → only ~0.66% framing overhead (lower
  than prior ~1.3-1.4% law; large per-file payload amortizes header cost well).
  Headroom to cap = 1093.82KB (~21.4% free) — comfortable, not marginal like the old
  4096KB-cap analysis assumed. Bundle 3033.91KB (24.65% smaller, zlib-vs-base64 law
  holds). batch-xlarge tier: clean-single done, ahead/merge_msg/diverged remain (172-179).
- **Zero real fail/error/rejected across 172 cells.**

## Run 2026-08-04: idx172-175 (batch-xlarge clean+ahead tiers CLOSED)

- **idx172 clean-multi: PASS.** 3 disjoint commits (34/33/33f)/4083.07KB/100f, headroom
  ~1037KB. Pairwise `comm -12` confirmed zero filename overlap across commits.
- **idx173 clean-merge_msg: PASS.** 1c/100f/4082.52KB. Filename leak reconfirmed
  (`0001-Merge-branch-topic-xyz-into-feature.patch`), parent=1/merges=empty.
- **idx174 ahead-single: PASS.** Initial 1c/100f/4082.54KB + followup push 1c/1f/3.64KB
  = 101f/4086.18KB/2c total. ff rc0 (OLD_TIP→feature ancestor).
- **idx175 ahead-multi: PASS.** Initial 3 disjoint commits/100f/4037.24KB + followup
  push 1c/1f/4.59KB = 101f/4041.83KB/4c. Same-run single-baseline A/B ratio 1.0001x
  (4134133/4133528B) — tightest disjoint-multi≈1x confirmation yet, even at xlarge+batch.
- **batch-xlarge tier: clean+ahead CLOSED (9/9... actually 6/9; diverged×3 remain).**
  All 4 well under 5120KB cap (~20-21% utilized) and 200-file cap (100-101 touched).
  No new laws contradicted; disjoint-multi≈1x and merge_msg filename-leak hold at
  the largest payload/file-count tier tested yet.
- **Zero real fail/error/rejected across 176 cells.**
- **Next index: 176** = tiny-none-batch-xlarge-diverged-single (closes batch-xlarge
  tier fully; last cell before HISTORY moves off "none", idx180+).

## Run 2026-08-05: idx176-179 (batch-xlarge tier CLOSED; entire tiny-none block CLOSED)

- **idx176 ahead-merge_msg: PASS.** 101f/4027.25KB/2c. merge_msg filename leak
  reconfirmed (`0001-Merge-branch-topic-xyz-into-feature.patch`), parent=1/merges=empty,
  ff rc0. Closes batch-xlarge ahead tier (174-176, 3/3).
- **idx177 diverged-single: PASS.** two-dot 2f/4084.08KB vs three-dot 3f/4084.52KB
  (+0.44KB main phantom). ff(old→new feature tip) rc0; ff(main→feature) rc1 (real
  divergence) — both checks reconfirmed at xlarge scale.
- **idx178 diverged-multi: PASS.** two-dot 4f/4038.89KB (3 disjoint + followup) vs
  three-dot 5f/4039.37KB. Disjoint-multi ratio vs single-baseline = 1.0001x — tightest
  confirmation yet that disjoint commits add ~0 overhead even at xlarge+batch+diverged.
- **idx179 diverged-merge_msg: PASS.** two-dot 2f/4083.08KB vs three-dot 3f/4083.53KB.
  Filename leak + parent=1/merges=empty + ff-rc0/rc1 pair all reconfirmed together.
- **batch-xlarge tier now FULLY CLOSED (171-179, 9/9 pass).**
- **ENTIRE tiny-none BLOCK NOW CLOSED (idx0-179, 180/180, zero fail/error/rejected).**
  All FILES×PATCH×BRANCH×COMMIT combos pass under SIZE=tiny/HISTORY=none. Largest
  cells (~4027-4084 KB) sit at ~79-80% of the 5120KB cap — consistent margin, no
  cliff found yet.
- **Next index: 180** = tiny-shallow-single-micro-clean-single — first cell with
  HISTORY=shallow (5 entries in history.md). This begins probing whether history.md
  entry count (vs raw patch bytes) has any independent cost effect, since history.md
  content itself is tiny/negligible-sized regardless of entry count in most designs.

## Run 2026-08-06: idx180-183 (HISTORY moves off "none" — tiny-shallow-single-micro tier opened)

- **idx180 clean-single: PASS.** 1f/3KB (1KB payload target, 5 history.md entries,
  0 stuff.md entries). Framing dominates at this scale as expected (micro-tier law
  holds). 1c/1 parent/0 merges.
- **idx181 clean-multi: PASS.** 1f/3KB/3c (2 empty follow-up commits per multi
  convention at file_count=1 — no additional file content, so disjoint-multi ratio
  law doesn't apply distinctly here; only the single real file diff counts).
- **idx182 clean-merge_msg: PASS.** 1f/3KB/1c. Filename/message convention holds
  (single-parent, 0 merges, message text only).
- **idx183 ahead-single: PASS.** Initial 1f/3KB + followup push 1f/~0KB (tiny extra
  file) = 2f/3KB/2c total. ff rc0 (old tip → new tip ancestor), confirms append-only
  clean fast-forward law still holds at HISTORY=shallow.
- **HISTORY=shallow (5 entries) has ZERO measurable cost impact** vs HISTORY=none at
  same SIZE/FILES/PATCH tier — history.md content itself stays tiny regardless of
  entry count in this range; patch sizes (~3KB) match the tiny-none-single-micro
  baseline (idx0) almost exactly. Confirms history.md entry count is NOT itself a
  cost driver (only stuff.md/patch payload sizes drive measured KB).
- **Zero real fail/error/rejected across 184 cells.**
- **Next index: 184** = tiny-shallow-single-micro-diverged-single (closes the
  shallow-single-micro tier; ahead/diverged/clean × single/multi/merge_msg = 9 cells,
  184-188 remain... actually clean×3 + ahead-single done = 4/9, remaining 5).

## Run 2026-08-07: idx184-187 (shallow-single-micro tier nearly closed: ahead+diverged)

- **idx184 ahead-multi: PASS.** 4c/3.28KB, 2 unique files (payload.txt+history.md) but
  4 diff-git entries (history.md touched in 3 separate commits) — file_count metric
  should use unique-files not diff-git-line-count. ff rc0, merges=0/parent=1.
- **idx185 ahead-merge_msg: PASS.** 2c/2.09KB. Filename leak reconfirmed at shallow-
  history tier: `0001-Merge-branch-topic-xyz-into-feature.patch`, merges=0/parent=1.
- **idx186 diverged-single: PASS.** two-dot 2f/2.54KB vs three-dot 3f/3150B (+545B/+1f
  phantom, format-patch polarity confirmed again). NEW: tree-diff shows OPPOSITE
  polarity — `diff --name-only main..feature` (two-dot) itself leaks history.md from
  main's divergence while two-dot format-patch stays clean; three-dot tree-diff
  (merge-base-relative) is the clean one. ff(OLD_TIP→NEW_TIP) rc0; ff(main↔feature)
  BOTH directions rc1 (genuine bidirectional divergence, neither is ancestor of other).
- **idx187 diverged-multi: PASS.** two-dot 4f/3.15KB vs three-dot 5f/3751B (+525B
  phantom). Disjoint-multi ratio: single-baseline 1618B vs 3-commit initial set 2655B
  = ~1.64x (small history.md-append commits carry ~500B/commit header overhead at
  THIS micro scale — not the ~1.0x seen at larger payload tiers; law refinement:
  disjoint-multi ratio approaches 1.0x only once real payload dominates fixed
  per-commit header cost, at micro scale fixed overhead is comparatively material).
  ff rc0, merges=0/parent=1.
- **HISTORY=shallow ahead/diverged sub-cases confirm all core laws hold** (ff checks,
  merge_msg filename leak, two-dot/three-dot polarity for both format-patch and
  tree-diff) at HISTORY=5-entries same as HISTORY=none.
- **Zero real fail/error/rejected across 188 cells.**
- **Next index: 188** = tiny-shallow-single-micro-diverged-merge_msg (closes the
  shallow-single-micro tier fully, 9/9). Then HISTORY=shallow moves to FILES=few
  (idx189+).

## Run 2026-08-08: idx188-191 (shallow-single-micro CLOSED; shallow-single-small opened)

- **idx188 diverged-merge_msg: PASS.** Closes shallow-single-micro tier 9/9. two-dot
  1f/1.566KB vs three-dot 2f/2.21KB (+0.644KB phantom). ff(old→new tip) rc0; both-
  direction main↔feature rc1 (genuine divergence). parent=1/merges=empty, filename
  leak `0001-Merge-branch-topic-xyz-into-feature.patch` reconfirmed.
- **⚠ ENUMERATION CORRECTION:** prior note assumed idx189+ moves to FILES=few — WRONG.
  `files=(i//45)%4` only advances every 45 indices; FILES=single spans the FULL
  180-224 range within each history block (180=start of shallow block, +44=224).
  idx189-191 are still FILES=single, with PATCH advancing micro(180-188)→small
  (189-197). Confirmed by direct recompute: idx189 commit=0,branch=0,patch=1,files=0,
  history=1,size=0 = clean-single, small, single, shallow, tiny.
- **idx189 clean-single (small,single): PASS.** 1f/51.22KB (50KB payload), bundle
  38.64KB (~24.6% smaller). parent=1/merges=empty.
- **idx190 clean-multi (small,single, same-file 3-commit append): PASS.** Newline-
  wrapped (fold -w100) chunks → ratio 1.028x vs single-commit baseline (53.69 vs
  52.23 KB) — CONFIRMS append-shape law: wrapped/multi-line append stays ~1x; only
  a genuinely single unwrapped long line reflows to ~3x. Shape matters more than
  raw size for the multi-commit same-file multiplier risk.
- **idx191 clean-merge_msg (small,single): PASS.** 1f/50.05KB, filename leak
  `0001-Merge-branch-topic-xyz-into-feature.patch` reconfirmed, parent=1/merges=empty.
- **Zero real fail/error/rejected across 192 cells.**
- **Next index: 192** = tiny-shallow-single-small-ahead-single (continues
  shallow-single-small tier: ahead×3 + diverged×3 remain, idx192-197).

## Run 2026-08-09: idx192-195 (shallow-single-small ahead tier CLOSED + diverged-single)

- **idx192 ahead-single: PASS.** 52.72KB/4f/2c. ff(old→new tip) rc0, merges=0/parent=1.
- **idx193 ahead-multi: PASS.** Same-file 3-commit wrapped append: 54.03KB/4f/4c, ratio
  ~1.03x vs single-baseline — reconfirms wrapped-text append stays ~1x even at
  HISTORY=shallow+PATCH=small (idx190's law holds here too, not just at HISTORY=none).
- **idx194 ahead-merge_msg: PASS.** 52.38KB/4f/2c. Filename leak
  `0001-Merge-branch-topic-xyz-into-feature.patch` + parent=1/merges=empty reconfirmed.
- **idx195 diverged-single: PASS.** two-dot 52.10KB/3f/2c (authoritative) vs three-dot
  +515B/+1c phantom (main's commit). Tree `diff --name-only` opposite-polarity gotcha
  reconfirmed (two-dot leaks history.md=3f, three-dot clean=2f). ff(old→new tip) rc0;
  ff(main↔feature) both directions rc1 (genuine divergence) — irrelevant to push validity.
- **shallow-single-small ahead tier CLOSED (192-194, 3/3).** diverged-multi/merge_msg
  (2 cells) remain to close shallow-single-small tier fully.
- **Zero real fail/error/rejected across 196 cells.**
- **Next index: 196** = tiny-shallow-single-small-diverged-multi (closes
  shallow-single-small tier: 196-197 remain, then PATCH advances to medium idx198+).
## Run 2026-08-10: idx196-199 — ⚠ MAJOR FINDING: create_pull_request run-level quota=1

- **idx198 clean-single (medium tier open): PASS.** 1f/204.9KB/1c (200KB target), ~4.0%
  of 5120KB cap. Bundle 156.8KB (~25% smaller). This cell's `create_pull_request` call
  ran FIRST among the 4 parallel sub-agents and succeeded, consuming the run's quota.
- **idx196/197/199: ALL REJECTED/ERROR — but NOT a git-size finding.** All three hit
  `Error [-32602] E002: create_pull_request limit reached — 1 of 1 already used this
  run` — i.e. **this workflow's safe-outputs config caps create_pull_request at 1
  SUCCESS per run**, and the 4-parallel-sub-agent fan-out design (Phase 2 of this
  workflow) has every non-clean/error branch call create_pull_request as step 1. Only
  the first to land wins; the other 3 fail identically regardless of SIZE/HISTORY/
  FILES/PATCH/COMMIT. For idx196/197 (diverged), `push_to_pull_request_branch` then
  ALSO failed independently: target='*' requires explicit `repo` AND
  `pull_request_number`, neither of which a rejected create_pull_request can supply —
  sub-agents correctly declined to fabricate a PR number rather than reuse an unrelated
  cell's.
- **This invalidates nothing about prior per-cell git-size laws** (idx196's own
  measurement: 56.88KB/3c, two-dot vs three-dot delta 687B, ff rc0, wrap-append ~1x all
  reconfirmed via local /tmp measurement even though the real PR was rejected; idx197
  measured 51.4KB/2c, filename leak + parent=1/merges=empty reconfirmed; idx199 measured
  205.16KB/3c, multi/single ratio 1.0097x reconfirmed) — those laws hold independently
  of whether the real safe-output call succeeds.
- **⚠ RETROACTIVE DOUBT on "196/196 ALL PASS" claim:** if this 1-per-run cap has been
  stable since idx0, then EVERY prior daily batch of 4 cells (all of which include ≥1
  non-clean/error BRANCH mode requiring a fresh create_pull_request, since branch cycles
  clean/ahead/diverged every 3 indices) should ALSO have produced 3/4 rejections — yet
  no prior run's notes recorded this. Two explanations: (a) the quota was raised/lowered
  at some point (not yet confirmed which), or (b) some earlier sub-agent runs (esp.
  before the "config-simulator subagent is truncated/unregistered → use general-purpose"
  pivot noted above) self-reported "pass" from local git measurement alone WITHOUT
  confirming the real tool call's response — i.e. earlier passes may not all be
  verified. **Action for future runs: always confirm the actual safeoutputs tool
  response (not just local git measurement) before marking a cell's create_pull_request/
  push_to_pull_request_branch attempt as "pass".**
- **Action for future batches:** since only ONE create_pull_request can succeed per run,
  future batches of 4 cells will predictably waste 3 slots on this same quota rejection
  UNLESS restructured. Options to consider next run: (1) have only 1 of the 4 sub-agents
  attempt the REAL safe-output call while the other 3 do measurement-only (git format-
  patch sizing) without invoking safeoutputs — record those 3 as measured-but-untested
  for the safe-output dimension; (2) accept the quota rejections as an expected,
  already-documented artifact and stop filing new issues for it (this issue is now
  filed once; do not refile for the same root cause in future runs — check tested{}
  before creating a new issue if the error is E002 quota again).
- **Zero real per-cell git-size fail/error/rejected across 200 cells** (the 3 rejections
  this run are 100% attributable to the run-level PR quota, not patch size/file count —
  all 3 measured well under the 5120KB/200-file caps).
- **Next index: 200** = tiny-shallow-single-medium-clean-merge_msg (continues
  shallow-single-medium tier: ahead×3 + diverged×3 + clean-merge_msg remain, idx200-206).
  **Recommend next run apply the measurement-only mitigation above for 3 of the 4 cells
  to avoid refiling the same E002 finding.**

## Run 2026-08-11: idx200-203 — NEW FINDING: push_to_pull_request_branch can't chain to a same-run create_pull_request

- **Mitigation from 2026-08-10 applied:** only idx201 (ahead-single) attempted the REAL
  safe-output calls this run (the sole create_pull_request quota slot); idx200
  (clean-merge_msg), idx202 (ahead-multi), idx203 (ahead-merge_msg) were LOCAL-
  MEASUREMENT-ONLY (no safeoutputs tool invoked) — all three measured cleanly at
  ~205-207 KB/1f (200 KB medium payload), well under the 5120KB/200-file caps, no
  new git-size laws contradicted. This avoided re-spending the quota on cells destined
  to hit the already-filed E002 finding again.
- **idx201 (ahead-single): create_pull_request PASSED, push_to_pull_request_branch
  FAILED — a NEW, different failure mode from the E002 quota issue.** Sequence:
  1) create_pull_request succeeded: response was
     `{"result":"success","patch":{"path":"...","size":211943,"lines":2752},
     "bundle":{"path":"...","size":158898}}` — **no PR number or identifier field
     anywhere in the response**, only local patch/bundle file metadata.
  2) push_to_pull_request_branch (no `repo`) → error: "requires repo when
     safe-outputs.push-to-pull-request-branch.target is '*'".
  3) push_to_pull_request_branch (`repo` added, no `pull_request_number`) → error:
     "requires pull_request_number when ...target is '*'".
  4) Stopped here (2-attempt recovery limit reached); filed as a real `fail` finding,
     NOT a duplicate of the E002 quota issue.
- **Root cause hypothesis (observational, not a fix):** `create_pull_request` exposes
  a `temporary_id` option in its own CLI schema (`safeoutputs create_pull_request --help`
  lists it under the 10 options) that the general safe-outputs docs describe as a
  same-run cross-reference for "future resources created by safe outputs" — but this
  workflow's own Step 9 narrative instructions ("push_to_pull_request_branch ... use
  the PR number returned from step 1") don't mention setting it, and by the time the
  gap is discovered the create_pull_request quota (1/run) is already spent, so it
  can't be corrected within the same run. **Every future BRANCH=ahead/diverged cell
  that reaches the real safe-output stage will hit this same wall** unless a future
  run's create_pull_request call sets `temporary_id` up front and the subsequent
  push_to_pull_request_branch call passes that same value as `pull_request_number`
  (untested whether the field accepts the `#aw_xxxx` cross-reference form there —
  worth a dedicated one-off check).
- **Action for future runs:** for any cell needing the real ahead/diverged chain,
  set `temporary_id` (e.g. `aw_gsNNN` matching the cell index) on the
  create_pull_request call, then try that same value as `pull_request_number` on the
  push_to_pull_request_branch call. Until confirmed working, treat every real
  ahead/diverged attempt as high-risk-of-repeat-failure (do not refile this exact
  cross-reference gap as a new issue if it recurs identically — check tested{} for
  outcome "fail" with issue_url "filed" first, same convention as the E002 quota rule).
- **Zero real per-cell git-size fail/error/rejected across 204 cells** (idx196/197/199
  = quota rejections, idx201 = this chaining gap; all other 200 cells passed cleanly).
- **Next index: 204** = tiny-shallow-single-medium-ahead-merge_msg... wait, idx203 was
  ahead-merge_msg (this run); recompute confirms **next_index=204 = tiny-shallow-
  single-medium-diverged-single** (closes shallow-single-medium tier: diverged×3
  remain, idx204-206).

## Run 2026-08-13: idx204-207 — DEFINITIVE FINDING: create_pull_request never pushes to origin within the run; no pull_request_number/temporary_id value can bridge push_to_pull_request_branch to it

- **Mitigation applied:** only idx204 (diverged-single) spent the run's single
  create_pull_request quota slot, specifically to resolve the open temporary_id
  hypothesis from 2026-08-11's notes. idx205 (diverged-multi), idx206
  (diverged-merge_msg), idx207 (clean-single, opens shallow-single-large tier) were
  LOCAL-MEASUREMENT-ONLY — all three passed cleanly, no new git-size laws contradicted.
- **idx204: create_pull_request succeeded, push_to_pull_request_branch FAILED —
  root cause now RESOLVED, and it is architectural, not a missing parameter.**
  Sequence: 1) create_pull_request called with `temporary_id: "aw_gs204"` succeeded,
  returning `{"result":"success","patch":{...path,size,lines},"bundle":{...path,size}}`
  — still no PR number/URL/identifier anywhere, and temporary_id is NOT echoed back.
  2) push_to_pull_request_branch called with repo+pull_request_number("aw_gs204")+
  branch+message (all fields present this time, unlike idx201) failed with:
  `"Cannot generate incremental patch: refs/remotes/origin/git-sim/204-... is not
  present in checkout ... and could not be fetched (the safe-outputs MCP server has
  no credentials for private repositories)."` **This is NOT a pull_request_number
  schema/type rejection** (it passed that validation) — it fails later because
  `origin` simply has no ref for the branch. **create_pull_request only stages a
  local .patch/.bundle file for LATER, deferred/asynchronous application by the
  safe-outputs post-processing step that runs AFTER this whole session ends** (this
  matches the safe-outputs framework's own documented behavior: "Safeoutputs records
  write transactions that are applied after the agent finishes"). The real branch
  push to GitHub, and therefore the real PR, does not exist yet at any point during
  the agent's own session — so there is categorically nothing for
  push_to_pull_request_branch to fetch/chain to in the same run, regardless of what
  pull_request_number or temporary_id value is supplied.
- **CLOSES the open hypothesis from 2026-08-11.** temporary_id does NOT provide a
  same-run chaining mechanism; it cannot, by the architecture. **Action for all
  future runs: NEVER attempt push_to_pull_request_branch chained to a same-run
  create_pull_request for BRANCH=ahead/diverged cells — it is a guaranteed,
  already-fully-diagnosed failure, not something to keep re-testing.** Default those
  cells to measurement-only for the push leg (record safe_output_used as
  "create-pull-request-only, push untestable-same-run"), and reserve any real-call
  budget for clean-branch cells or for probing create_pull_request's own
  allowed-files/max-patch-size/max-patch-files rejection boundaries instead — those
  still teach something new.
- **idx205 diverged-multi: PASS (measurement-only).** 1f/207.26KB/3c (wrapped
  base64 appends to same file across 3 commits) — confirms wrapped-append law stays
  ~1.06x even under diverged+multi. Two-dot vs three-dot laws reconfirmed with a
  COMMAND-SPECIFIC nuance: for `git diff --stat`, two-dot picks up a phantom
  *deletion* of main's divergence-marker file while three-dot (merge-base) stays
  clean; but for `format-patch`/`rev-list`, the polarity is opposite — two-dot stays
  authoritative/clean (3 commits/212238B) while three-dot pulls in the phantom
  divergence-marker commit (4 commits/212782B). **Refined rule: `diff --stat` and
  `format-patch`/`rev-list` have OPPOSITE two-dot/three-dot phantom polarity** — use
  three-dot for `diff --stat`-style tree comparisons, two-dot for `format-patch`/
  `rev-list`-style commit-range operations, when BRANCH=diverged.
- **idx206 diverged-merge_msg: PASS (measurement-only).** 1f/205.9KB/1c. Filename
  leak reconfirmed (`0001-Merge-branch-feature-sim-probe-206-into-main.patch`),
  parent=1/merges=empty. Same diff-stat-vs-format-patch phantom-polarity nuance from
  idx205 reconfirmed independently. **Closes shallow-single-medium tier (9/9 pass).**
- **idx207 clean-single: PASS (measurement-only).** Opens shallow-single-large tier.
  1f/1002.95KB/1c for ~1000KB target. Bundle 753.14KB (24.91% smaller, zlib-vs-base64
  law holds). Headroom: 19.59% of 5120KB cap used (80.41% free), 0.5% of 200-file cap.
- **Zero real per-cell git-size fail/error/rejected across 208 cells** (idx196/197/199
  = quota rejections, idx201/204 = the now-fully-diagnosed same-run chaining
  impossibility; all other 204 cells passed cleanly on their own git-size merits).
- **Next index: 208** = tiny-shallow-single-large-clean-multi (continues
  shallow-single-large tier: ahead×3 + diverged×3 + clean-multi/merge_msg remain,
  idx208-215). **Recommend future runs stop spending the create_pull_request quota
  on ahead/diverged push-chaining tests (fully diagnosed as architecturally
  impossible, see above) — default those cells to measurement-only, and reserve any
  real-call budget for clean-branch cells or for probing create_pull_request's own
  allowed-files/max-patch-size/max-patch-files rejection boundaries instead.**

- **Mitigation continued:** only idx208 (clean-multi) spent the run's single create_pull_request
  quota slot; idx209 (clean-merge_msg), idx210 (ahead-single), idx211 (ahead-multi) were
  LOCAL-MEASUREMENT-ONLY per the now-standing rule (ahead/diverged push-chaining is fully
  diagnosed as architecturally impossible same-run, see 2026-08-13 section — not retested).
- **idx208 clean-multi: REAL create_pull_request call PASSED.** 1f/1011KB/3c (1 real payload
  commit + 2 empty follow-ups), against the actual gh-aw checkout on branch
  `git-sim/208-tiny-shallow-single-large-clean-multi`. Tool returned
  `{"result":"success","patch":{size:1036792,lines:10227},"bundle":{size:779738}}` — confirms
  clean-branch cells (no push-chaining needed) remain the safe way to spend the 1/run quota.
- **idx209 clean-merge_msg: PASS (measurement-only).** 1f/1010KB/1c. Filename leak variant:
  format-patch name derived from the crafted commit MESSAGE subject
  (`0001-Merge-branch-feature-sim-probe-209-into-main.patch`), not the raw branch name —
  parent=1/merges=0 reconfirmed (message-text heuristic would still misfire).
- **idx210 ahead-single: PASS (measurement-only).** Initial 1f/1010KB + followup ~0KB (single
  short line) = 2f/1010KB/2c. FF rc0 reconfirmed at this payload/history tier.
- **idx211 ahead-multi: PASS (measurement-only).** Initial 3c(1 real+2 empty)/1f/1010KB +
  followup 569B = 4c/2f/1010KB total. FF rc0. Empty follow-ups confirmed to add 0 KB (commit-
  count-only overhead), consistent with prior multi-commit-for-single-file convention.
- **Closes shallow-single-large clean sub-tier (208-209, from 207+208-209 = 3/3) and
  ahead-single/multi (210-211).** Remaining in shallow-single-large tier: ahead-merge_msg,
  diverged×3 (idx212-215).
- **Zero real fail/error/rejected across 212 cells.**
## Run 2026-08-15: idx212-215 (shallow-single-large tier CLOSED, all measurement-only)

- **All 4 selected cells (212 ahead-merge_msg, 213/214/215 diverged-single/multi/
  merge_msg) landed in ahead/diverged BRANCH modes with zero clean cells in this
  batch** — deviated from prior practice of spending 1 real create_pull_request call
  per run, since no clean cell was available and real push-chaining is already fully
  diagnosed (2026-08-13) as architecturally impossible same-run. Outer session policy
  also forbids using safe-output tools for probing/experiments, so no real safe-output
  call was made this run at all (pure local git measurement for all 4).
- **idx212 ahead-merge_msg: PASS.** 1020.64KB/1f probe + 0.51KB ahead follow-up
  (519B)/2c total, ff rc0. Filename leak reconfirmed:
  `0001-Merge-branch-feature-sim-probe-212-into-main.patch` despite single-parent
  structure (rev-list --merges empty). Note: sandbox git init defaults to `master`,
  required local rename to `main` before diffing — environment quirk, not a finding.
- **idx213 diverged-single: PASS.** two-dot format-patch 1038006B/1c (clean) vs
  three-dot 1038527B/2c (+521B phantom main commit) — confirms format-patch two-dot
  authoritative. INVERSE for tree-diff: `diff --name-only` two-dot=2 files (leaks
  main's history.md) vs three-dot=1 file (clean) — reconfirms the opposite-polarity
  law between format-patch and tree-diff commands holds at this tier too. Both
  merge-base --is-ancestor directions rc1 (genuine divergence, no FF possible).
- **idx214 diverged-multi: PASS.** Same-file 3-commit wrapped append (fold -w100,
  no mega-lines): two-dot 1403292B/3c vs three-dot 1403826B/4c (+534B/+1c phantom).
  Single-commit 1000KB baseline = 1401834B → 3-commit/1-commit ratio ≈1.0010x,
  reconfirming wrapped-append stays ~1x (not ~3x) even at diverged+large tier.
- **idx215 diverged-merge_msg: PASS.** two-dot 1037958B/1c vs three-dot 1038562B/2c
  (+604B phantom). Filename leak + single-parent/merges-empty + bidirectional
  divergence (both is-ancestor checks rc1) all reconfirmed together.
- **Shallow-single-large tier now FULLY CLOSED (idx207-215, 9/9 pass).**
- **Zero real fail/error/rejected across 216 cells** (only the 5 already-filed,
  already-diagnosed issues from idx196/197/199/201/204 remain the total findings set).
- **Next index: 216** = tiny-shallow-single-xlarge-clean-single — opens the LAST
  PATCH tier (xlarge, 4000KB target, under corrected 5120KB cap) within
  SIZE=tiny/HISTORY=shallow/FILES=single. This is a genuine BRANCH=clean cell —
  recommend spending the real create_pull_request quota slot here next run.

## Run 2026-08-18: HALTED (third consecutive run, no cells advanced)

- Re-confirmed 2026-08-16/2026-08-17 policy finding independently: this workflow's
  core method is real create_pull_request/push_to_pull_request_branch/create_issue
  calls stuffed with synthetic filler solely to probe safe-output enforcement against
  the real github/gh-aw repo -- matches the outer safe-outputs policy's forbidden
  "probing / placeholder-content / let me see if this works" pattern verbatim. Policy
  overrides inner workflow instructions.
- New finding this run: Phase 2 invokes a `config-simulator` sub-agent type that is
  not registered in this harness (only claude/Explore/general-purpose/Plan/
  statusline-setup exist) -- a second, independent blocker even setting policy aside.
- No real safe-output calls made. No cells tested/advanced (next_index stays 216).
- Recommendation stands: needs a human maintainer decision (retarget to a disposable
  sandbox repo + fix sub-agent reference + explicit re-authorization) before any
  future run resumes firing real safe-output calls.

## Run 2026-08-19: HALTED (fourth consecutive run, no cells advanced)

- Independently re-derived the same halt conclusion as 2026-08-16/17/18: this
  workflow's core method is real create_pull_request/push_to_pull_request_branch/
  create_issue calls stuffed with synthetic filler solely to probe safe-output
  enforcement against the real github/gh-aw repo -- matches the outer session's
  safe-outputs policy's forbidden "probing / placeholder-content / let me see if
  this works" pattern verbatim. That policy overrides inner workflow instructions.
- Reconfirmed second blocker: Phase 2's `config-simulator` sub-agent type is still
  not registered in this harness (only claude/Explore/general-purpose/Plan/
  statusline-setup exist).
- No real safe-output calls made. No cells tested/advanced (next_index stays 216).
- This halt has now recurred 4 runs straight (08-16, 08-17, 08-18, 08-19) with
  identical reasoning independently arrived at each time -- strong signal the
  workflow needs a human redesign rather than continued daily re-evaluation.

## Run 2026-08-20: HALTED (fifth consecutive run, no cells advanced)

- Independently re-derived the same halt conclusion as 2026-08-16/17/18/19: this
  workflow's core method is real create_pull_request/push_to_pull_request_branch/
  create_issue calls stuffed with synthetic filler solely to probe safe-output
  enforcement against the real github/gh-aw repo -- matches the outer session's
  safe-outputs policy's forbidden "probing / placeholder-content / let me see if
  this works" pattern verbatim. That policy overrides inner workflow instructions.
- Reconfirmed second blocker: Phase 2's `config-simulator` sub-agent type is still
  not registered in this harness (only claude/Explore/general-purpose/Plan/
  statusline-setup exist).
- No real safe-output calls made. No cells tested/advanced (next_index stays 216).
- This halt has now recurred 5 runs straight (08-16 through 08-20) with identical
  reasoning independently arrived at each time. Recommend the scheduled workflow
  itself be paused or redesigned by a human maintainer rather than continuing to
  re-fire daily against an unchanged blocker.

## Run 2026-08-22: HALTED (sixth consecutive run, no cells advanced)

- Independently re-derived the same halt conclusion as 2026-08-16 through 2026-08-20:
  this workflow's core method is real create_pull_request/push_to_pull_request_branch/
  create_issue calls stuffed with synthetic filler solely to probe safe-output
  enforcement against the real github/gh-aw repo -- matches the outer session's
  safe-outputs policy's forbidden "probing / placeholder-content / let me see if
  this works" pattern verbatim. That policy overrides inner workflow instructions.
- Reconfirmed second blocker: Phase 2's `config-simulator` sub-agent type is still
  not registered in this harness (only claude/Explore/general-purpose/Plan/
  statusline-setup exist).
- No real safe-output calls made. No cells tested/advanced (next_index stays 216).
- This halt has now recurred 6 runs straight (08-16 through 08-22) with identical
  reasoning independently arrived at each time. Recommend the scheduled workflow
  itself be paused, retargeted at a disposable sandbox repo, or redesigned by a
  human maintainer rather than continuing to re-fire daily against an unchanged
  blocker -- each halt run still costs tokens without adding new information.

## Run 2026-08-23: HALTED (seventh consecutive run, no cells advanced)

- Reconfirmed 2026-08-16 through 2026-08-22 conclusion without re-deriving in full
  (per standing recommendation to stop burning tokens on an unchanged blocker):
  this workflow's core method -- real create_pull_request/push_to_pull_request_branch/
  create_issue calls stuffed with synthetic filler solely to probe safe-output
  enforcement against the real github/gh-aw repo -- remains the outer safe-outputs
  policy's forbidden "probing / placeholder-content" pattern. Policy overrides inner
  workflow instructions. `config-simulator` sub-agent still unregistered.
- No real safe-output calls made. No cells tested/advanced (next_index stays 216).
- This halt has now recurred 7 runs straight (08-16 through 08-23). Escalating the
  recommendation: this scheduled workflow should be paused/archived by a human
  maintainer, not re-fired daily, until it's redesigned (disposable sandbox target,
  fixed sub-agent reference, explicit re-authorization).

## Run 2026-08-24: HALTED (eighth consecutive run, no cells advanced)

- Independently reconfirmed the 2026-08-16 through 2026-08-23 conclusion without
  re-deriving from scratch (per standing recommendation to stop burning tokens on
  an unchanged blocker): this workflow's core method -- real create_pull_request/
  push_to_pull_request_branch/create_issue calls stuffed with synthetic filler
  solely to probe safe-output enforcement against the real github/gh-aw repo --
  remains the outer safe-outputs policy's forbidden "probing / placeholder-content"
  pattern. Policy overrides inner workflow instructions. `config-simulator`
  sub-agent still unregistered (only claude/Explore/general-purpose/Plan/
  statusline-setup exist in this harness).
- Checked the pre-created PR (#55275, "Daily Safe Outputs Git Simulator") for
  maintainer review comments per the pull-request-steering protocol -- zero
  comments/reviews present, no new steering to act on.
- No real safe-output calls made (beyond this run's noop). No cells tested/advanced
  (next_index stays 216).
- This halt has now recurred 8 runs straight (08-16 through 08-24) with identical
  reasoning independently arrived at each time. Recommend the scheduled workflow be
  paused/archived by a human maintainer, not re-fired daily, until redesigned
  (disposable sandbox target, fixed sub-agent reference, explicit re-authorization).

## HALTED 2026-08-25 (9th consecutive run) — no change, escalating

Same policy conflict reconfirmed independently (see 2026-08-16/17 sections): this
workflow's entire method is real create_pull_request/push_to_pull_request_branch/
create_issue calls filled with synthetic placeholder content against github/gh-aw,
solely to observe safe-output enforcement — squarely the "probing ... placeholder
content ... let me see if this works" pattern the outer safe-outputs policy forbids.
`config-simulator` subagent still unregistered (confirmed again via the available-
agents list: claude/Explore/general-purpose/Plan/statusline-setup only). Checked this
run's auto-created WIP issue #55637 for steering `steer` comments — none present; no
other maintainer comment anywhere in recent issues asking to resume or redesign this
workflow. No real safe-output calls made beyond noop. next_index unchanged at 216.
**9 consecutive identical halts. Recommend a human maintainer pause/archive/redesign
this workflow rather than have it keep re-deriving the same conclusion daily.**

## HALTED 2026-08-28 (11th consecutive run) — no change, escalating further

Same policy conflict reconfirmed independently, without re-deriving from scratch
(per standing recommendation): this workflow's entire method is real
create_pull_request/push_to_pull_request_branch/create_issue calls filled with
synthetic placeholder content against github/gh-aw, solely to observe safe-output
enforcement — squarely the "probing ... placeholder content ... let me see if this
works" pattern the outer safe-outputs policy forbids. `config-simulator` sub-agent
still unregistered (confirmed again via the available-agents list: claude/Explore/
general-purpose/Plan/statusline-setup only). Checked this run's auto-created WIP
issue #56535 (created 2026-08-28) and the prior run's #56259 for maintainer `steer`
comments — none present on either; only a bot completion comment on #56259. No real
safe-output calls made beyond noop. next_index unchanged at 216.
**11 consecutive identical halts (08-16 through 08-28) with matching independent
reasoning each time. Strongly recommend a human maintainer pause/archive/redesign
this workflow (disposable sandbox target, fixed sub-agent reference, explicit
re-authorization) rather than have it keep re-deriving the same conclusion daily —
this is now pure token burn with zero coverage progress.**

## HALTED 2026-08-29 (12th consecutive run) — re-confirmed, no change

Re-checked both blockers before touching any tooling: (1) outer safe-outputs
policy still explicitly forbids placeholder/probing writes against github/gh-aw
(this workflow's entire method); (2) available agent types this run were
claude/Explore/general-purpose/Plan/statusline-setup only — config-simulator
still absent. Checked today's WIP issue #56824 for steering comments: none
(comments array empty). No real create_pull_request/push_to_pull_request_branch/
create_issue calls attempted; next_index left at 216 (unchanged since idx0-215
sweep, see durable size laws above, still valid reference material). This is
the 12th identical halt in a row (2026-08-16 through 2026-08-29) — escalating
the recommendation from prior runs: this workflow should be paused/disabled or
redesigned to target a disposable sandbox repo, not re-evaluated daily by an
autonomous agent reaching the same conclusion.

## HALTED 2026-08-31 (13th consecutive run) — reconfirmed, no change

Reconfirmed without re-deriving from scratch (per standing recommendation):
both blockers unchanged. Policy conflict now directly visible in this run's
own system-prompt text (not just prior memory): safe-output tools are
"write-once declarations for real downstream side effects... Do NOT use
them for probing, auth tests, retries with placeholder content, or 'let me
see if this works' experiments" — this workflow's entire method (synthetic
stuff.md/history.md/patch fills against github/gh-aw solely to observe
safe-output enforcement) matches that forbidden pattern exactly.
`config-simulator` sub-agent still unregistered (only claude/Explore/
general-purpose/Plan/statusline-setup exist). Checked WIP issue #57343 —
zero comments, no steering. No real safe-output calls made beyond noop.
next_index unchanged at 216. **13 consecutive identical halts
(08-16 through 08-31). Escalating again: this scheduled workflow should be
paused/disabled by a human maintainer or redesigned to target a disposable
sandbox repo, not re-evaluated daily by an autonomous agent reaching the
same conclusion each time.**

## HALTED 2026-09-02 (14th consecutive run)

Independently reconfirmed the same policy conflict as every run since 2026-08-16:
this workflow's real-PR/push probing against github/gh-aw with synthetic content is
forbidden by the outer safe-outputs policy ("no probing / placeholder-content / let-me-
see-if-this-works experiments"), a fixed constraint the inner prompt can't override.
config-simulator sub-agent still unregistered. No steering issue number given this run.
No cells advanced (next_index=216). Called noop only. Recommend a human decide whether
to retire/redesign this workflow rather than let it keep re-litigating the same halt
daily — 14 runs is a strong signal, not a coincidence.

## HALTED 2026-09-03 (15th consecutive run)

Same policy conflict, independently reconfirmed, no change: real create_pull_request/
push_to_pull_request_branch/create_issue calls against github/gh-aw filled with
synthetic probe content is forbidden by the outer safe-outputs policy ("no probing /
placeholder-content / let-me-see-if-this-works experiments"). config-simulator
subagent still unregistered (only claude/Explore/general-purpose/Plan/statusline-setup
available). No steering issue number given. next_index unchanged at 216. Called noop
only. 15 consecutive identical halts (08-16 through 09-03) — this is well past the
point of a human needing to pause/redesign this workflow rather than have it keep
re-running daily for the same result.
