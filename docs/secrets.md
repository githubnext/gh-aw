# üîê Secrets Management

Agentic workflows automatically handle several types of secrets and support custom secret references.

## Automatically Provided Secrets

These secrets are automatically available in all workflows:

### `GITHUB_TOKEN`
- **Purpose**: GitHub API access for repository operations
- **Scope**: Permissions defined in workflow `permissions:` section
- **Usage**: Automatically used by GitHub tools and MCP servers

```yaml
permissions:
  issues: write      # GITHUB_TOKEN gets issue write access
  contents: read     # GITHUB_TOKEN gets content read access
```

## User-Defined Secrets
