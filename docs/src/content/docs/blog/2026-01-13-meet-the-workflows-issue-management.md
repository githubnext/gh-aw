*Ah!* Let's discuss the art of managing issues and pull requests at [Peli's Agent Factory](/gh-aw/blog/2026-01-12-welcome-to-pelis-agent-factory/)! A most delicious topic indeed!

In our [previous post](/gh-aw/blog/2026-01-13-meet-the-workflows-documentation/), we explored documentation and content workflows - agents that maintain glossaries, technical docs, slide decks, and blog content. We learned how we took a heterogeneous approach to documentation agents - some workflows generate content, others maintain it, and still others validate it.

Now let's talk about the daily rituals of software development: managing issues and pull requests. GitHub provides excellent primitives for collaboration, but there's ceremony involved - linking related issues, merging main into PR branches, assigning work, closing completed sub-issues, optimizing templates. These are small papercuts individually, but they can add up to significant friction.

## Issue & PR Management Workflows

These agents enhance issue and pull request workflows:

- **[Issue Arborist](https://github.com/githubnext/gh-aw/tree/bb7946527af340043f1ebb31fc21bd491dd0f42d/.github/workflows/issue-arborist.md?plain=1)** - Links related issues as sub-issues  
- **[Issue Monster](https://github.com/githubnext/gh-aw/tree/bb7946527af340043f1ebb31fc21bd491dd0f42d/.github/workflows/issue-monster.md?plain=1)** - Assigns issues to AI agents one at a time
- **[Mergefest](https://github.com/githubnext/gh-aw/tree/bb7946527af340043f1ebb31fc21bd491dd0f42d/.github/workflows/mergefest.md?plain=1)** - Automatically merges main branch into PR branches
- **[Sub Issue Closer](https://github.com/githubnext/gh-aw/tree/bb7946527af340043f1ebb31fc21bd491dd0f42d/.github/workflows/sub-issue-closer.md?plain=1)** - Closes completed sub-issues automatically
- **[Issue Template Optimizer](https://github.com/githubnext/gh-aw/tree/bb7946527af340043f1ebb31fc21bd491dd0f42d/.github/workflows/issue-template-optimizer.md?plain=1)** - Improves issue templates based on usage

The Issue Arborist automatically links related issues, building a dependency tree we'd never maintain manually.

The Issue Monster became our task dispatcher for AI agents - it assigns one issue at a time to agents, preventing the chaos of parallel work on the same codebase.

Mergefest eliminates the "please merge main" dance that happens on long-lived PRs.

The Issue Template Optimizer analyzes which fields in our templates actually get filled out and suggests improvements ("nobody uses the 'Expected behavior' field, remove it").

Issue and PR management workflows don't replace GitHub's features; they enhance them, removing ceremony and making collaboration feel smoother.
