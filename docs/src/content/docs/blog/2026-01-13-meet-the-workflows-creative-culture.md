Let's explore the fun side of [Peli's Agent Factory](/gh-aw/blog/2026-01-12-welcome-to-pelis-agent-factory/)!

Okay, let's take a breath. We've covered some serious territory - triage systems, quality checks, security compliance, and [operations & release](/gh-aw/blog/2026-01-13-meet-the-workflows-operations-release/) workflows. These workflows are critical infrastructure that keeps our agent factory running smoothly, from handling incoming issues to shipping software reliably.

But here's the thing: work doesn't have to be all business. While we were building these serious, production-critical workflows, we also discovered something unexpected - AI agents can bring joy, build team culture, and create moments of delight. Not every workflow needs to solve a critical problem; some can simply make your day better. Let's explore the playful side of our agent factory, where we learned that personality and fun drive engagement just as powerfully as utility.

## 🎨 Creative & Culture Workflows

Not everything needs to be serious! These agents remind us that work can be fun:

- **[Poem Bot](https://github.com/githubnext/gh-aw/tree/532a0412680638e5e93b6e8c5ea9b8074fe6be22/.github/workflows/poem-bot.md?plain=1)** - Responds to `/poem-bot` commands with creative verses (yes, really)

- **[Daily Team Status](https://github.com/githubnext/gh-aw/tree/532a0412680638e5e93b6e8c5ea9b8074fe6be22/.github/workflows/daily-team-status.md?plain=1)** - Shares team mood and status updates

- **[Daily News](https://github.com/githubnext/gh-aw/tree/532a0412680638e5e93b6e8c5ea9b8074fe6be22/.github/workflows/daily-news.md?plain=1)** - Curates relevant news for the team

Okay, hear us out: the Poem Bot started as a joke. Someone said "wouldn't it be funny if we had an agent that writes poems about our code?" and then we actually built it. And you know what? People *love* it. It became a team tradition to invoke `/poem-bot` after particularly gnarly PR merges. We learned that AI agents don't have to be all business - they can build culture and create moments of joy.

The Daily News workflow curates relevant articles, but it also adds commentary and connects them to our work. These "fun" workflows have higher engagement than some of our "serious" ones, which tells you something about what makes people actually want to interact with automation.
