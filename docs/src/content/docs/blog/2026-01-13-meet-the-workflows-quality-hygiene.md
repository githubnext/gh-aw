Welcome back to Peli's Agent Factory!

In our [previous post](/gh-aw/blog/2026-01-13-meet-the-workflows/), we explored how triage and summarization workflows help us stay on top of incoming activity - automatically labeling issues, creating digestible summaries, and narrating the day's events in an engaging way. These workflows taught us that tone matters and that even simple automation dramatically reduces cognitive load.

Now let's shift from *reacting* to activity to *maintaining* quality. While triage workflows help us handle what comes in, quality and hygiene workflows act as vigilant caretakers - spotting problems before they escalate and keeping our codebase healthy. These are the agents that investigate failed CI runs, detect schema drift, and catch breaking changes before users do.

## 🔍 Quality & Hygiene Workflows

These are our diligent caretakers - the agents that spot problems before they become, well, bigger problems:

- **[CI Doctor](https://github.com/githubnext/gh-aw/tree/main/.github/workflows/ci-doctor.md)** - Investigates failed workflows and opens diagnostic issues (it's like having a DevOps specialist on call 24/7)
- **[Schema Consistency Checker](https://github.com/githubnext/gh-aw/tree/main/.github/workflows/schema-consistency-checker.md)** - Detects when schemas, code, and docs drift apart
- **[Breaking Change Checker](https://github.com/githubnext/gh-aw/tree/main/.github/workflows/breaking-change-checker.md)** - Watches for changes that might break things for users

The CI Doctor was a revelation. Instead of drowning in CI failure notifications, we now get *timely*, *investigated* failures with actual diagnostic insights. The agent doesn't just tell us something broke - it analyzes logs, identifies patterns, searches for similar past issues, and even suggests fixes. We learned that agents excel at the tedious investigation work that humans find draining.

The Schema Consistency Checker caught drift that would have taken us days to notice manually. 

These "hygiene" workflows became our first line of defense, catching issues before they reached users.

## What's Next?

With quality and hygiene workflows maintaining our codebase health, we needed a way to understand whether they were actually working. How do you know if your agents are performing well? That's where metrics and analytics come in.
