*Onwards, onwards!* Let's keep exploring the wonders of [Peli's Agent Factory](/gh-aw/blog/2026-01-12-welcome-to-pelis-agent-factory/)! To the *command center* where instant magic happens!

In our [previous post](/gh-aw/blog/2026-01-13-meet-the-workflows-creative-culture/), we explored creative and culture workflows - agents that bring joy, build team culture, and create moments of delight. We discovered that AI agents don't have to be all business; they can have personality while making work more enjoyable.

But sometimes you need help *right now*, at the exact moment you're stuck on a problem. You don't want to wait for a scheduled run - you want to summon an expert agent with a command. That's where interactive workflows and ChatOps come in. These agents respond to slash commands and GitHub reactions, providing on-demand assistance with full context of the current situation.

We learned that the right agent at the right moment with the right information is a valuable addition to an agent portfolio.

## Interactive & ChatOps Workflows

These agents respond to commands, providing on-demand assistance whenever you need it:

- **[Q](https://github.com/githubnext/gh-aw/tree/bb7946527af340043f1ebb31fc21bd491dd0f42d/.github/workflows/q.md?plain=1)** - Workflow optimizer that investigates performance and creates PRs  
- **[Grumpy Reviewer](https://github.com/githubnext/gh-aw/tree/bb7946527af340043f1ebb31fc21bd491dd0f42d/.github/workflows/grumpy-reviewer.md?plain=1)** - Performs critical code reviews with personality
- **[Workflow Generator](https://github.com/githubnext/gh-aw/tree/bb7946527af340043f1ebb31fc21bd491dd0f42d/.github/workflows/workflow-generator.md?plain=1)** - Creates new workflows from issue requests

Interactive workflows changed how we think about agent invocation. Instead of everything running on a schedule, these respond to slash commands and reactions - `/q` summons the workflow optimizer, a 🚀 reaction triggers analysis. Q (yes, named after the James Bond quartermaster) became our go-to troubleshooter - it investigates workflow performance issues and opens PRs with optimizations.

The Grumpy Reviewer gave us surprisingly valuable feedback with a side of sass ("This function is so nested it has its own ZIP code"). We learned that **context is king** - these agents work because they're invoked at the right moment with the right context, not because they run on a schedule.

## Next Up: Testing & Validation Workflows

While ChatOps agents respond to commands, we also need workflows that continuously verify our systems still function as expected.
