Triage and analysis workflows provide intelligent automation for managing issues, investigating problems, and ensuring quality standards through deep analytical capabilities.

You can write your own workflows designed for your specific project requirements. Here are some sample workflows from the Agentics collection to get you started:

### 🏷️ Issue Triage
Automatically triage issues and pull requests with intelligent labeling and analysis.

- **What it does**: Analyzes new issues, applies appropriate labels, and provides initial triage comments
- **Why it's valuable**: Ensures consistent issue management and reduces manual triage overhead
- **Learn more**: [Issue Triage Documentation](https://github.com/githubnext/agentics/blob/main/docs/issue-triage.md)

### 🤖 Issue Triage with LLM CLI
Automated issue triage using the simonw/llm CLI tool for flexible LLM provider selection.

- **What it does**: Analyzes new issues and provides classification, priority assessment, and triage recommendations
- **Why it's valuable**: Offers flexibility in LLM provider choice (OpenAI, Anthropic) and demonstrates custom engine patterns
- **Try it**: [issue-triage-llm.md](https://github.com/githubnext/gh-aw/blob/main/.github/workflows/issue-triage-llm.md)

### 🏥 CI Doctor
Monitor CI workflows and automatically investigate failures with deep root cause analysis.

- **What it does**: Investigates failed CI runs, identifies patterns, and provides actionable fix recommendations
