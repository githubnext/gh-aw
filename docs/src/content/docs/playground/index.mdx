import WorkflowHeroPlayground from '../../../components/WorkflowHeroPlayground.astro';

export const workflows = [
  {
    id: 'project-board-draft-updater',
    label: 'Update project board (draft)',
  },
  {
    id: 'project-board-issue-updater',
    label: 'Update project board (issue)',
  },
];

This is not a live playground anymore. These examples are compiled GitHub Actions workflows with a “Hero-like” view: workflow Markdown on the left, job graph and last-run status on the right.

Prefer a full-width, 3-column view? Open [/gh-aw/playground-3up/](/gh-aw/playground-3up/).

<WorkflowHeroPlayground
  workflows={workflows}
  initialWorkflowId="project-board-draft-updater"
/>

> The “Last run” panel is powered by JSON snapshots in this repo at `docs/src/assets/playground-snapshots/*.json`.

## Try It Yourself

Ready to experiment with GitHub Agentic Workflows? Here are some ways to get started:

1. **Create a test repository**: Set up a new repository or use an existing one to experiment safely
2. **Install gh-aw**: Follow the [Quick Start guide](/gh-aw/setup/quick-start/) to install the extension
3. **Create your first workflow**: Copy the example above, save it as `.github/workflows/my-workflow.md`, and compile it with `gh aw compile`
