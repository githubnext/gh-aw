Quality and testing workflows focus on improving code quality through automated test coverage analysis, performance optimization, and systematic quality improvements.

You can write your own workflows tailored to your specific needs. Here are some sample workflows from the Agentics collection to get you started:

### ðŸ§ª Daily Test Coverage Improver
Improve test coverage by adding meaningful tests to under-tested areas.

- **What it does**: Analyzes test coverage, identifies gaps, and creates PRs with new comprehensive tests
- **Why it's valuable**: Systematically improves code quality and reduces bugs through better test coverage
- **Learn more**: [Daily Test Coverage Improver Documentation](https://github.com/githubnext/agentics/blob/main/docs/daily-test-improver.md)

### âš¡ Daily Performance Improver
Analyze and improve code performance through benchmarking and optimization.

- **What it does**: Identifies performance bottlenecks, runs benchmarks, and implements optimization improvements
- **Why it's valuable**: Proactively improves application performance and identifies optimization opportunities
- **Learn more**: [Daily Performance Improver Documentation](https://github.com/githubnext/agentics/blob/main/docs/daily-perf-improver.md)
