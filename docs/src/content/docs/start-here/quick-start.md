This guide will get you from zero to a running agentic workflow in minutes. You'll install the extension, add a sample workflow, set up the required secrets, and run it.

## üöÄ Quick Start

**Prerequisites**

- A repository you are a maintainer of, can push to (or a fork) and have permission to add Actions secrets.

- A Personal Access Token for GitHub Copilot CLI (recommended), or an Anthropic Claude or OpenAI API key. 

**Step 1 ‚Äî Install the extension**

- Install the [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/).

- Install the GitHub Agentic Workflows extension:

```bash wrap
gh extension install githubnext/gh-aw
```

If this step fails, you may need to use a personal access token or run the [install-gh-aw.sh script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/githubnext/gh-aw/refs/heads/main/install-gh-aw.sh).

**Step 2 ‚Äî Initialize the repository**

Initialize your repository to set up GitHub Copilot instructions and prompt files:

```bash wrap
gh aw init
```

This creates:
- `.github/instructions/github-agentic-workflows.instructions.md` - Custom Copilot instructions for better workflow authoring
- `.github/prompts/create-agentic-workflow.prompt.md` - The `/create-agentic-workflow` command for Copilot Chat
- `.github/prompts/create-shared-agentic-workflow.prompt.md` - The `/create-shared-agentic-workflow` command for creating reusable workflow components

:::tip[VS Code integration]
Once initialized, GitHub Copilot will automatically use these instructions when you edit workflow files in VS Code. See [VS Code Integration](/gh-aw/tools/vscode/) for more details.
:::

**Step 3 ‚Äî Add a sample workflow, review and merge**

The easiest way to get started is to add a sample from [The Agentics](https://github.com/githubnext/agentics) collection. From your repository root run:

```bash wrap
gh aw add githubnext/agentics/weekly-research --pr
```

This creates a pull request that adds `.github/workflows/weekly-research.md` and the compiled `.lock.yml`. Review and merge the PR into your repo.

**Step 4 ‚Äî Add an AI secret**

Agentic workflows use a coding agent: GitHub Copilot CLI (default), Claude or Codex.

For GitHub Copilot CLI please [create a GitHub Fine-Grained Personal Access Token (PAT) for an account with a GitHub Copilot subscription](https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens/new) with the "```Copilot Requests```" permission selected/checked with "```Access: Read-only```" and add this as a repository secret name "```COPILOT_CLI_TOKEN```":

```bash
gh secret set COPILOT_CLI_TOKEN -a actions --body "<your-personal-access-token>"
```

**Optional: Add GITHUB_MCP_TOKEN for Remote GitHub Tools**

If you plan to use the remote GitHub MCP server (faster, no Docker required) with `mode: remote`, you'll need to set the `GITHUB_MCP_TOKEN` secret. This is a GitHub Personal Access Token with appropriate repository permissions:

```bash
gh secret set GITHUB_MCP_TOKEN -a actions --body "<your-github-pat>"
```

See [GitHub Tools configuration](/gh-aw/reference/tools/#github-remote-mode) for more details on remote mode.

For Claude and Codex, see the instructions in [AI Engines](/gh-aw/reference/engines/).

**Step 5 ‚Äî Trigger a run of the workflow in GitHub Actions**

Trigger the workflow immediately in GitHub Actions:

```bash wrap
gh aw run weekly-research
```

After a few moments, you can check the status of the run:

```bash wrap
gh aw status
```

Once the run is complete, a new issue will be created in your repository with a research report! The report will be automatically generated by the AI based on recent developments in your field, and will be refreshed every week.

## üìù Understanding Your First Workflow

Let's look at what you just added. The weekly research workflow automatically triages new issues:

```aw wrap
---
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: "0 9 * * 1"  # Every Monday at 9 AM
safe-outputs:
  create-issue:
---

# Weekly Research Report

Create a weekly research report summarizing recent developments in our field:

1. Research recent developments and trends
2. Summarize key findings 
3. Create an issue with the research report
4. Tag relevant team members

Keep the report concise but informative.
```

This workflow:
- **Triggers** every Monday at 9 AM via cron schedule
- **Has permissions** to read repository content and write issues
- **Uses tools** to create GitHub issues
- **Runs AI instructions** in natural language to create research reports

## What's next?

Now that you have your first workflow running:

- **Customize the workflow** ‚Äî Edit the `.md` file to fit your needs, then recompile with `gh aw compile`
- **Explore more samples** ‚Äî Check out [The Agentics](https://github.com/githubnext/agentics) repository
- **Learn about adding and updating workflows** ‚Äî Read [Packaging and Imports](/gh-aw/guides/packaging-imports/) to understand workflow management
- **Learn the concepts** ‚Äî Read [Concepts](/gh-aw/start-here/concepts/) to understand how agentic workflows work

You're ready to start automating with agentic workflows! ‚ú®
