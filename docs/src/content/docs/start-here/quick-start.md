This guide will get you from zero to a running agentic workflow in minutes. You'll install the extension, add a sample workflow, set up the required secrets, and run it.

:::note[What you'll learn]
This guide uses a pre-built workflow from the Agentics catalog to get you started quickly. After completing this tutorial, explore:
- [Creating custom workflows](/gh-aw/tools/agentic-authoring/) with AI assistance
- [Understanding concepts](/gh-aw/start-here/concepts/) behind agentic workflows
- [Browsing more examples](/gh-aw/samples/research-planning/) from the catalog

## 🚀 Quick Start

**Prerequisites**

- A repository you are a maintainer of, can push to (or a fork), with Actions, Discussions and Issues enabled, and you have permission to add Actions secrets.

- A Personal Access Token for GitHub Copilot CLI, or an Anthropic Claude or OpenAI API key. 

**Step 1 — Install the extension**

- Install the [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/).

- Install the GitHub Agentic Workflows extension:

```bash wrap
gh extension install githubnext/gh-aw
```

If this step fails, you may need to use a personal access token or run the [install-gh-aw.sh script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/githubnext/gh-aw/refs/heads/main/install-gh-aw.sh).

**Step 2 — Initialize for workflow authoring (Optional)**

If you want to create custom workflows conversationally with AI, initialize your repository:

```bash wrap
gh aw init
```

This sets up GitHub Copilot custom instructions and creates the `/create-agentic-workflow` prompt file. You can use this later to design workflows through conversation in GitHub Copilot Chat or CLI.

For this guide, we'll use a pre-built workflow from the catalog. See [Workflow Authoring](/gh-aw/tools/agentic-authoring/) to learn about creating workflows with AI assistance.

**Step 3 — Add a sample workflow, review and merge**

The easiest way to get started is to add a sample from [The Agentics](https://github.com/githubnext/agentics) collection. From your repository root run:

```bash wrap
gh aw add githubnext/agentics/weekly-research --pr
```

This creates a pull request that adds `.github/workflows/weekly-research.md` and the compiled `.lock.yml`. Review and merge the PR into your repo.

**Step 4 — Add an AI secret**

Agentic workflows use a coding agent: GitHub Copilot CLI (default), Claude or Codex.

For GitHub Copilot CLI, create a fine-grained Personal Access Token (PAT) with the "Copilot Requests" permission enabled:

1. Visit https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens/new
2. Under "Permissions," click "add permissions" and select "Copilot Requests"
3. Generate your token
4. Add the token to your repository secrets as `COPILOT_CLI_TOKEN`:

```bash
gh secret set COPILOT_CLI_TOKEN -a actions --body "<your-personal-access-token>"
```

For more information, see the [official documentation](https://github.com/github/copilot-cli?tab=readme-ov-file#authenticate-with-a-personal-access-token-pat).

For Claude and Codex, see the instructions in [AI Engines](/gh-aw/reference/engines/).

**Step 5 — Trigger a run of the workflow in GitHub Actions**

Trigger the workflow immediately in GitHub Actions:

```bash wrap
gh aw run weekly-research
```

After a few moments, you can check the status of the run:

```bash wrap
gh aw status
```

Once the run is complete, a new discussion post will be created in your repository with a research report! The report will be automatically generated by the AI based on recent developments in your field, and will be refreshed every week.

## 📝 Understanding Your First Workflow

Let's look at what you just added. The weekly research workflow automatically creates a research report every week and posts it as a discussion in your repository, and looks like this:

```aw wrap
---
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: "0 9 * * 1"  # Every Monday at 9 AM
safe-outputs:
  create-issue:
---

# Weekly Research Report

Create a weekly research report summarizing recent developments in our field:

1. Research recent developments and trends
2. Summarize key findings 
3. Create an issue with the research report
4. Tag relevant team members

Keep the report concise but informative.
```

This workflow:
- **Triggers** every Monday at 9 AM via cron schedule
- **Has permissions** to read repository content and write issues
- **Uses tools** to create GitHub issues
- **Runs AI instructions** in natural language to create research reports

## What's next?

Now that you have your first workflow running:

- **Create your own workflow** — Use [Workflow Authoring](/gh-aw/tools/agentic-authoring/) to design custom workflows with AI assistance
- **Explore more samples** — Check out [The Agentics](https://github.com/githubnext/agentics) repository for ready-to-use workflows
- **Learn the concepts** — Read [Concepts](/gh-aw/start-here/concepts/) to understand how agentic workflows work
- **Customize existing workflows** — Edit the `.md` file to fit your needs, then recompile with `gh aw compile`

You're ready to start automating with agentic workflows! ✨
