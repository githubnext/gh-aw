## Natural Language to GitHub Actions

GitHub Agentic Workflows transforms natural language markdown files into GitHub Actions that are executed by AI agents. Here's a simple example:

```markdown wrap
---
on:
  issues:
    types: [opened]
permissions: read-all 
safe-outputs:
  add-comment:
---
# Issue Clarifier

Analyze the current issue and ask for additional details if the issue is unclear.
```

The `gh aw` cli compiles this into a GitHub Actions Workflow (.yml) that runs an AI agent (Claude, Codex, ...) in a containerized environment whenever a new issue is opened in the repository.

The AI agent reads your repository context, understands the issue content, and takes appropriate actions - all defined in natural language rather than complex code.

**Security Benefits:** Workflows use read-only permissions by default, with write operations only allowed through sanitized `safe-outputs`. Access can be gated to team members only, ensuring AI agents operate within controlled boundaries.

  </FeatureCard>
</FeatureGrid>

Sample workflows are from the [Agentics collection](https://github.com/githubnext/agentics).

> **GitHub Agentic Workflows is a research demonstrator from [GitHub Next](https://githubnext.com/) and [Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/research-software-engineering-rise/).** It is in early development and may change significantly. Using agentic workflows requires careful attention to security considerations and human supervision. Use with caution and at your own risk.
> These are demonstrator workflows for experimental use. Review all outputs carefully and use time-limited trials to evaluate effectiveness for your team.
