> [!WARNING]

> Review all outputs carefully and use time-limited trials to evaluate effectiveness for your team.

## Prerequisites

You'll need a repository where you can push changes and add Actions secrets, with Actions, Discussions and Issues enabled. You'll also need a Personal Access Token (PAT) for GitHub Copilot CLI, or an Anthropic Claude or OpenAI API key. 

### Step 1 — Install the extension

Install the [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/), then install the GitHub Agentic Workflows extension:

```bash wrap
gh extension install githubnext/gh-aw
```

If this step fails, you may need to use a personal access token or run the [install-gh-aw.sh script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/githubnext/gh-aw/refs/heads/main/install-gh-aw.sh).

### Step 2 — Add a sample workflow

Add a sample from the [agentics](https://github.com/githubnext/agentics) collection. From your repository root run:

```bash wrap
gh aw add githubnext/agentics/daily-team-status --pr
```

This creates a pull request that adds `.github/workflows/daily-team-status.md` and the compiled `.lock.yml`. Review and merge the PR into your repo.

### Step 3 — Add an AI secret

Agentic workflows use a coding agent: GitHub Copilot CLI (default), Claude or Codex.

**For GitHub Copilot CLI**, create a fine-grained Personal Access Token (PAT) with the "Copilot Requests" permission enabled:

1. Visit https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens/new
2. Under "Resource owner", select your user account (not an organization, see note below).
3. Under "Repository access," select "Public repositories"
4. Under "Permissions," click "Add permissions" and select "Copilot Requests". If you are not finding this option, review steps 2 and 3.
5. Generate your token
6. Add the token to your repository secrets as `COPILOT_GITHUB_TOKEN`:

```bash wrap
gh secret set COPILOT_GITHUB_TOKEN -a actions --body "<your-personal-access-token>"
```

:::note
There is an ongoing work to support authentication with the GitHub Action token. 
Once this work is deployed, you will not need to create a token for Copilot CLI.
:::

For more information, see the [GitHub Copilot CLI documentation](https://github.com/github/copilot-cli?tab=readme-ov-file#authenticate-with-a-personal-access-token-pat).

**For Claude and Codex**, see the instructions in [AI Engines](/gh-aw/reference/engines/).

### Step 4 — Trigger a workflow run

Trigger the workflow immediately in GitHub Actions:

```bash wrap
gh aw run daily-team-status
```

After a few moments, check the status:

```bash wrap
gh aw status
```

Once complete, a new discussion post will be created in your repository with a daily news! The report will be automatically generated by the AI based on recent activity in your repository.

## Understanding Your First Workflow

Let's look at what you just added. The daily team status workflow automatically creates a status report every weekday and posts it as a discussion in your repository, and looks like this:

```aw wrap
---
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: "0 9 * * 1-5"
  workflow_dispatch:
permissions:
  contents: read
  issues: read
  pull-requests: read
network: defaults
tools:
  github:
safe-outputs:
  create-discussion:

# Daily Team Status

Create an upbeat daily status report for the team as a GitHub discussion.
- Recent repository activity (issues, PRs, discussions, releases, code changes)
- Team productivity suggestions and improvement ideas
- Community engagement highlights
- Project investment and feature recommendations

...

1. Gather recent activity from the repository
2. Create a new GitHub discussion with your findings and insights
```

This workflow triggers every weekday at 9 AM via cron schedule, has permissions to read repository content and create GitHub discussions, and runs AI instructions in natural language to generate status reports.

## Customize Your Workflow

Customize your workflow by editing the `.md` file and recompiling with `gh aw compile`. 
You can leverage the help of an agent to customize your workflow without having to learn about the YAML syntax. Run the following command to start an interactive session with GitHub Copilot CLI.

```bash wrap
# install copilot cli
npm install -g @github/copilot-cli
# install the custom agent files
gh aw init
```

Then, run the following to create and edit your workflow:

```bash wrap
# start an interactive session to customize the workflow
copilot
> /agent create-agentic-workflow
> edit @.github/workflows/daily-team-status.md
```
