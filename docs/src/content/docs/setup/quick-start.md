## Prerequisites

You'll need a repository where you can push changes and add Actions secrets, with Actions, Discussions and Issues enabled. You'll also need a Personal Access Token (PAT) for GitHub Copilot CLI, or an Anthropic Claude or OpenAI API key. 

### Step 1 — Install the extension

Install the [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/), then install the GitHub Agentic Workflows extension:

```bash wrap
gh extension install githubnext/gh-aw
```

If this step fails, you may need to use a personal access token or run the [install-gh-aw.sh script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/githubnext/gh-aw/refs/heads/main/install-gh-aw.sh).

### Step 2 — Add a sample workflow

Add a sample from the [agentics](https://github.com/githubnext/agentics) collection. From your repository root run:

```bash wrap
gh aw add githubnext/agentics/weekly-research --pr
```

This creates a pull request that adds `.github/workflows/weekly-research.md` and the compiled `.lock.yml`. Review and merge the PR into your repo.

### Step 3 — Add an AI secret

Agentic workflows use a coding agent: GitHub Copilot CLI (default), Claude or Codex.

**For GitHub Copilot CLI**, create a fine-grained Personal Access Token (PAT) with the "Copilot Requests" permission enabled:

1. Visit https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens/new
2. Under "Resource owner", select your user account (not an organization, see note below).
3. Under "Repository access," select "Public repositories"
4. Under "Permissions," click "Add permissions" and select "Copilot Requests". If you are not finding this option, review steps 2 and 3.
5. Generate your token
6. Add the token to your repository secrets as `COPILOT_GITHUB_TOKEN`:

```bash wrap
gh secret set COPILOT_GITHUB_TOKEN -a actions --body "<your-personal-access-token>"
```

:::note
There is an ongoing work to support authentication with the GitHub Action token. 
Once this work is deployed, you will not need to create a token for Copilot CLI.
:::

For more information, see the [GitHub Copilot CLI documentation](https://github.com/github/copilot-cli?tab=readme-ov-file#authenticate-with-a-personal-access-token-pat).

**For Claude and Codex**, see the instructions in [AI Engines](/gh-aw/reference/engines/).

### Step 4 — Trigger a workflow run

Trigger the workflow immediately in GitHub Actions:

```bash wrap
gh aw run weekly-research
```

After a few moments, check the status:

```bash wrap
gh aw status
```

Once complete, a new discussion post will be created in your repository with a research report! The report will be automatically generated by the AI based on recent developments in your field, and will be refreshed every week.

## Understanding Your First Workflow

Let's look at what you just added. The weekly research workflow automatically creates a research report every week and posts it as a discussion in your repository, and looks like this:

```aw wrap
---
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: "0 9 * * 1"  # Every Monday at 9 AM
safe-outputs:
  create-issue:
---

# Weekly Research Report

Create a weekly research report summarizing recent developments in our field:

1. Research recent developments and trends
2. Summarize key findings 
3. Create an issue with the research report
4. Tag relevant team members

Keep the report concise but informative.
```

This workflow triggers every Monday at 9 AM via cron schedule, has permissions to read repository content and create GitHub issues, and runs AI instructions in natural language to generate research reports.

## What's next?

Customize your workflow by editing the `.md` file and recompiling with `gh aw compile`. Use [Authoring Agentic Workflows](/gh-aw/setup/agentic-authoring/) to create workflows with AI assistance, explore more samples in the [agentics](https://github.com/githubnext/agentics) repository, and learn about workflow management in [Packaging & Distribution](/gh-aw/guides/packaging-imports/). To understand how agentic workflows work, read [How It Works](/gh-aw/introduction/how-it-works/).
