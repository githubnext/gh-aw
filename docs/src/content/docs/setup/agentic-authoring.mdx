This agentic experience works with **all AI agents** (Copilot, Claude, Codex) and can be used from multiple interfaces - through the **GitHub web interface** (github.com), from your **terminal** with the Copilot CLI or Claude CLI, or in **VS Code**. You can create powerful automation workflows using natural language, with the flexibility to choose the tools that fit your workflow.

## Using GitHub Copilot from the GitHub Web interface

Initialize your repository for agentic workflows by starting a GitHub Copilot agent session in **github.com** with this prompt:

```text wrap
Initialize the repository for GitHub Agentic Workflows using https://github.com/githubnext/gh-aw/blob/main/copilot-setup.md
```

This will guide the Copilot agent to:
1. Install the `gh-aw` CLI extension
2. Run `gh aw init` to create necessary configuration files
3. Commit and push the changes

After initialization, you'll have:
- `.github/aw/github-agentic-workflows.instructions.md` - Custom Copilot instructions for better workflow authoring
- `.github/agents/agentic-workflows.agent.md` - [Agent file](/gh-aw/reference/glossary/#agent-files) (custom AI instructions) for the `/agent agentic-workflows` command in Copilot Chat
- Additional configuration files for workflow authoring

## Using Copilot CLI or Claude CLI from the Terminal

You can also set up and author agentic workflows interactively from your terminal using the Copilot CLI or Claude CLI. This approach is ideal for developers who prefer command-line workflows or want to integrate setup into their development environment.

### Setup with Copilot CLI

If you have [GitHub Copilot CLI](https://githubnext.com/projects/copilot-cli) installed, you can use it to set up your repository interactively:

```bash
copilot-cli "Initialize this repository for GitHub Agentic Workflows following the guide at https://github.com/githubnext/gh-aw/blob/main/install.md"
```

The Copilot CLI agent will:
1. Check if `gh-aw` CLI extension is installed (and install it if needed)
2. Run `gh aw init` to configure the repository
3. Guide you through any required secret configuration
4. Commit and push the initialization changes

### Setup with Claude CLI

If you prefer using Claude from the terminal, you can use it to guide the setup process:

```bash
claude "Help me set up GitHub Agentic Workflows in this repository following https://github.com/githubnext/gh-aw/blob/main/install.md"
```

Claude will walk you through the installation process interactively, checking your environment and helping configure the necessary secrets and files.

### Benefits of Terminal-Based Setup

Using the CLI offers several advantages:

- **Direct environment access**: The agent can check installed tools, run commands, and verify setup
- **Interactive guidance**: Get real-time help with troubleshooting and configuration
- **Flexible AI choice**: Use your preferred AI assistant (Copilot or Claude)
- **Full installation guide**: The `install.md` file provides comprehensive setup instructions optimized for AI agents

> [!TIP]
> The [`install.md`](https://github.com/githubnext/gh-aw/blob/main/install.md) file is specifically designed to guide AI agents through the complete setup process, including installation, configuration, and troubleshooting.

## What is the `agentic-workflows` agent?

`.github/agents/agentic-workflows.agent.md` is a unified dispatcher agent that routes your workflow requests to specialized prompts based on your intent. An [agent file](/gh-aw/reference/glossary/#agent-files) is a specialized instruction set that customizes AI behavior for specific tasks.

Use the agent when you want to:
- **Create** a new agentic workflow using natural language
- **Debug** an existing workflow to investigate failures or analyze logs
- **Update** an existing workflow to add features or modify behavior
- **Upgrade** workflows to new gh-aw versions or fix deprecations

The agent intelligently determines your intent and loads the appropriate specialized prompt for your task.

## How to use the `agentic-workflows` agent

In GitHub Copilot Chat (on github.com or in VS Code), or in the interactive Copilot CLI session, invoke the agent with the `/agent` command and specify your intent:

```sh wrap
# Create a new workflow
/agent agentic-workflows create a workflow that triages issues

# Debug an existing workflow
/agent agentic-workflows debug why is my workflow failing?

# Update a workflow
/agent agentic-workflows update add web-fetch tool to issue-classifier

# Upgrade workflows
/agent agentic-workflows upgrade all workflows to latest version
```

The agent will understand your intent and route to the appropriate specialized prompt for your task.

## Other Agents and Chats

The agent file can be loaded into other AI chat interfaces that support custom instructions. The agent is designed to be compatible with various AI tools, although some features might require configuration and you'll need to allow running the compiler.

## Dictating Agentic Workflows

When creating agentic workflows using speech-to-text (dictation), you may encounter terminology mismatches and formatting issues common to voice recognition systems. To help correct these issues, use the [dictation instructions prompt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/githubnext/gh-aw/main/skills/dictation/SKILL.md) or <CopyEntireFileButton filePath="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/githubnext/gh-aw/main/skills/dictation/SKILL.md" label="Copy full instructions" />.

This prompt helps rephrase text captured through speech-to-text recognition by:
- Correcting project-specific terminology (e.g., "ghaw" → "gh-aw", "work flow" → "workflow")
- Transforming casual dictated sentences into clear, imperative task descriptions
- Removing filler words and improving technical tone
- Adding necessary context that might be implicit in spoken requests

Load the dictation prompt into your AI assistant before or after dictating your workflow instructions to improve accuracy and clarity.

## Designing Tasks with ChatGPT

When designing agentic workflow tasks, you can use the [agentic-chat instructions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/githubnext/gh-aw/main/skills/agentic-chat/SKILL.md) with ChatGPT or other conversational AI applications to create clear, actionable task descriptions. Use the button below to copy the full instructions: <CopyEntireFileButton filePath="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/githubnext/gh-aw/main/skills/agentic-chat/SKILL.md" label="Copy agentic-chat instructions" />.

The agentic-chat assistant helps you:
- Break down complex problems into clear, actionable phases
- Structure task descriptions for AI coding agents
- Write specifications without implementation details
- Follow best practices for agentic workflow task descriptions

To use the agentic-chat instructions:

1. Copy the full instructions using the button above
2. Paste them into your ChatGPT or other AI chat interface
3. Describe your workflow goal or problem
4. The assistant will ask clarifying questions and generate a structured task description
5. Copy the generated task description (wrapped in 5 backticks) and use it in your workflow

The assistant uses a neutral, technical tone and focuses on what needs to be done rather than how to implement it, making it ideal for creating specifications that AI coding agents can execute.

## Editing Workflows

### Using the Agentic-Workflows Agent (Recommended)

The easiest way to edit your workflows is to use the `/agent agentic-workflows` command in GitHub Copilot Chat:

```sh wrap
/agent agentic-workflows update add web-fetch tool to my-workflow
```

This approach automatically handles both content changes and recompilation, ensuring your workflow is ready to use.

### Manual Editing: Understanding Prompt vs Frontmatter

When manually editing workflow files (`.md` files in the `.github/workflows/` directory), it's important to understand the difference between the two main components:

### Workflow Prompt (Markdown Body)

The **workflow prompt** is the main markdown content that describes what you want the agent to do. This is the natural language task description.

- **Location**: The main body of the `.md` file (below the frontmatter)
- **Purpose**: Describes the task for the AI agent to execute
- **Editing**: Can be edited directly from the GitHub web interface without recompilation
- **Example**:
  ```markdown
  Triage the issue by analyzing its content, assigning appropriate labels,
  and adding a comment with your analysis.
  ```

> [!TIP]
> You can edit the workflow prompt directly through the GitHub web interface in your repository's `.github/workflows/*.md` files. Changes to the prompt take effect immediately in the next workflow run - no compilation needed.

### Frontmatter Configuration

The **frontmatter** is the YAML configuration block at the top of the workflow file that defines triggers, tools, permissions, and other settings.

- **Location**: Between `---` delimiters at the top of the `.md` file
- **Purpose**: Configures how the workflow runs (triggers, tools, permissions, etc.)
- **Editing**: **Requires recompilation** after manual changes
- **Example**:
  ```yaml
  ---
  engine: copilot
  on:
    issues:
      types: [opened]
  tools:
    github:
      toolsets: [issues]
  ---
  ```

> [!WARNING]
> After manually editing frontmatter configuration, you **must recompile** the workflow to regenerate the `.lock.yml` file:
> ```bash
> gh aw compile workflow-name.md
> ```
> The `.lock.yml` file is the compiled GitHub Actions workflow that actually runs. Changes to frontmatter won't take effect until you recompile and commit the updated `.lock.yml` file.
> 
> **Recommended**: Use the `/agent agentic-workflows` command instead, which handles recompilation automatically.

### Quick Reference

| What you're editing | Needs recompilation? | What it affects |
|---------------------|---------------------|-----------------|
| Markdown body (prompt) | ❌ No | The task description the agent receives |
| Frontmatter (YAML config) | ✅ Yes | Triggers, tools, permissions, and workflow settings |

## Upgrading Agentic Workflows

Keep your agentic workflows up-to-date with the latest `gh-aw` versions and features using the unified agentic-workflows agent:

```sh wrap
/agent agentic-workflows upgrade all workflows to latest version
```

The agent will:
- Detect all workflows in your repository
- Check for available updates to `gh-aw` version
- Update deprecated frontmatter configurations
- Fix compatibility issues with new features
- Recompile workflows after changes
- Generate a summary of upgraded workflows

### Upgrading Specific Workflows

You can upgrade individual workflows by specifying them in your prompt:

```sh wrap
/agent agentic-workflows upgrade issue-triage workflow
```

### What Gets Upgraded

The upgrade process handles:
- **Version updates**: Updates to latest compatible `gh-aw` version
- **Deprecated features**: Replaces deprecated configurations with current alternatives
- **Schema changes**: Updates frontmatter to match current schema requirements
- **Tool configurations**: Modernizes tool and MCP server setups
- **Permission changes**: Adjusts permissions to current best practices

> [!TIP]
> Run upgrades periodically to benefit from new features, security improvements, and bug fixes. The agent preserves your workflow logic while updating configuration.

## Importing Workflows

Import existing workflows from GitHub repositories using natural language prompts. The agentic-workflows agent can fetch, install, and configure workflows from any accessible GitHub repository:

```sh wrap
/agent agentic-workflows import workflow from https://github.com/githubnext/agentics/blob/main/workflows/ci-doctor.md
```

The agent will:
- Fetch the workflow file from the GitHub URL
- Install it in your `.github/workflows/` directory
- Update frontmatter with source tracking
- Configure necessary secrets and permissions
- Compile the workflow to `.lock.yml`
- Commit and push changes

### Import Workflow Variations

You can import workflows using different URL formats:

```sh wrap
# Import from file URL
/agent agentic-workflows import https://github.com/owner/repo/blob/main/workflows/issue-triage.md

# Import from raw GitHub URL
/agent agentic-workflows import https://raw.githubusercontent.com/owner/repo/main/workflows/pr-review.md

# Import with custom name
/agent agentic-workflows import ci-doctor workflow from githubnext/agentics as build-checker
```

### Import with Customization

When importing, you can specify customizations:

```sh wrap
# Import and change engine
/agent agentic-workflows import issue-triage from githubnext/agentics and use claude engine

# Import and add tools
/agent agentic-workflows import pr-review from owner/repo and add web-fetch tool
```

### Tracking Imported Workflows

Imported workflows automatically include a `source:` field in their frontmatter for tracking origin and enabling updates:

```yaml
---
source: githubnext/agentics/workflows/ci-doctor.md@v1.0.0
engine: copilot
---
```

This enables you to keep imported workflows synchronized with their source using the `gh aw update` command. See [Packaging & Distribution](/gh-aw/guides/packaging-imports/) for details on managing and updating imported workflows.

> [!NOTE]
> The agent handles all aspects of importing including fetching remote files, resolving dependencies, configuring secrets, and ensuring compatibility with your repository setup.

## Debugging Agentic Workflows

When workflows fail or behave unexpectedly, use the agentic-workflows agent to investigate and diagnose issues:

```sh wrap
/agent agentic-workflows debug why is my issue-triage workflow failing?
```

The debugging agent will:
- Download and analyze workflow run logs
- Identify errors and warnings
- Check tool and permission configurations
- Review MCP server connectivity
- Examine safe-input and safe-output configurations
- Suggest specific fixes for identified issues

### Debug Specific Run

Investigate a specific workflow run using its ID or URL:

```sh wrap
# Debug by run ID
/agent agentic-workflows debug run 1234567890

# Debug from GitHub Actions URL
/agent agentic-workflows debug https://github.com/owner/repo/actions/runs/1234567890
```

### Common Debugging Scenarios

The agent can help with various debugging scenarios:

```sh wrap
# Permission errors
/agent agentic-workflows debug getting 403 errors in my workflow

# Missing tools
/agent agentic-workflows debug workflow says tool not found

# Network access issues
/agent agentic-workflows debug workflow cannot access external API

# Safe-output problems
/agent agentic-workflows debug agent output not creating issues
```

### Manual Debugging Tools

For hands-on debugging, `gh-aw` provides dedicated CLI commands:

```bash
# Download logs from recent runs
gh aw logs issue-triage --start-date -1d

# Audit a specific run in detail
gh aw audit 1234567890

# Inspect MCP server configuration
gh aw mcp inspect issue-triage

# Get JSON output for programmatic analysis
gh aw audit 1234567890 --json
```

### Understanding Debugging Output

The debugging agent provides:

- **Error Analysis**: Specific error messages and their causes
- **Missing Tools**: Tools the agent tried to use but weren't available
- **Permission Issues**: Missing or insufficient GitHub token permissions
- **Network Denials**: Firewall blocks or domain access problems
- **Configuration Errors**: Invalid frontmatter or compilation issues
- **Fix Recommendations**: Actionable steps to resolve each issue
