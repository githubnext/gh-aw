This experience uses GitHub Copilot to create powerful automation workflows using natural language. Everything can be done through the **GitHub web interface** - no local development environment or VS Code is required.

## Quick Start

Initialize your repository for agentic workflows by starting a GitHub Copilot agent session in **github.com** with this prompt:

```text wrap
Initialize the repository for GitHub Agentic Workflows using https://github.com/githubnext/gh-aw/blob/main/copilot-setup.md
```

This will guide the Copilot agent to:
1. Install the `gh-aw` CLI extension
2. Run `gh aw init` to create necessary configuration files
3. Commit and push the changes

After initialization, you'll have:
- `.github/aw/github-agentic-workflows.instructions.md` - Custom Copilot instructions for better workflow authoring
- `.github/agents/agentic-workflows.agent.md` - [Agent file](/gh-aw/reference/glossary/#agent-files) (custom AI instructions) for the `/agent agentic-workflows` command in Copilot Chat
- Additional configuration files for workflow authoring

## What is the `agentic-workflows` agent?

`.github/agents/agentic-workflows.agent.md` is a unified dispatcher agent that routes your workflow requests to specialized prompts based on your intent. An [agent file](/gh-aw/reference/glossary/#agent-files) is a specialized instruction set that customizes AI behavior for specific tasks.

Use the agent when you want to:
- **Create** a new agentic workflow using natural language
- **Debug** an existing workflow to investigate failures or analyze logs
- **Update** an existing workflow to add features or modify behavior
- **Upgrade** workflows to new gh-aw versions or fix deprecations

The agent intelligently determines your intent and loads the appropriate specialized prompt for your task.

## How to use the `agentic-workflows` agent

In GitHub Copilot Chat (on github.com or in VS Code), or in the interactive Copilot CLI session, invoke the agent with the `/agent` command and specify your intent:

```sh wrap
# Create a new workflow
/agent agentic-workflows create a workflow that triages issues

# Debug an existing workflow
/agent agentic-workflows debug why is my workflow failing?

# Update a workflow
/agent agentic-workflows update add web-fetch tool to issue-classifier

# Upgrade workflows
/agent agentic-workflows upgrade all workflows to latest version
```

The agent will understand your intent and route to the appropriate specialized prompt for your task.

## Other Agents and Chats

The agent file can be loaded into other AI chat interfaces that support custom instructions. The agent is designed to be compatible with various AI tools, although some features might require configuration and you'll need to allow running the compiler.

## Dictating Agentic Workflows

When creating agentic workflows using speech-to-text (dictation), you may encounter terminology mismatches and formatting issues common to voice recognition systems. To help correct these issues, use the [dictation instructions prompt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/githubnext/gh-aw/main/skills/dictation/SKILL.md) or <CopyEntireFileButton filePath="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/githubnext/gh-aw/main/skills/dictation/SKILL.md" label="Copy full instructions" />.

This prompt helps rephrase text captured through speech-to-text recognition by:
- Correcting project-specific terminology (e.g., "ghaw" → "gh-aw", "work flow" → "workflow")
- Transforming casual dictated sentences into clear, imperative task descriptions
- Removing filler words and improving technical tone
- Adding necessary context that might be implicit in spoken requests

Load the dictation prompt into your AI assistant before or after dictating your workflow instructions to improve accuracy and clarity.

## Designing Tasks with ChatGPT

When designing agentic workflow tasks, you can use the [agentic-chat instructions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/githubnext/gh-aw/main/skills/agentic-chat/SKILL.md) with ChatGPT or other conversational AI applications to create clear, actionable task descriptions. Use the button below to copy the full instructions: <CopyEntireFileButton filePath="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/githubnext/gh-aw/main/skills/agentic-chat/SKILL.md" label="Copy agentic-chat instructions" />.

The agentic-chat assistant helps you:
- Break down complex problems into clear, actionable phases
- Structure task descriptions for AI coding agents
- Write specifications without implementation details
- Follow best practices for agentic workflow task descriptions

To use the agentic-chat instructions:

1. Copy the full instructions using the button above
2. Paste them into your ChatGPT or other AI chat interface
3. Describe your workflow goal or problem
4. The assistant will ask clarifying questions and generate a structured task description
5. Copy the generated task description (wrapped in 5 backticks) and use it in your workflow

The assistant uses a neutral, technical tone and focuses on what needs to be done rather than how to implement it, making it ideal for creating specifications that AI coding agents can execute.

## Editing Workflows

### Using the Agentic-Workflows Agent (Recommended)

The easiest way to edit your workflows is to use the `/agent agentic-workflows` command in GitHub Copilot Chat:

```sh wrap
/agent agentic-workflows update add web-fetch tool to my-workflow
```

This approach automatically handles both content changes and recompilation, ensuring your workflow is ready to use.

### Manual Editing: Understanding Prompt vs Frontmatter

When manually editing workflow files (`.md` files in the `.github/workflows/` directory), it's important to understand the difference between the two main components:

### Workflow Prompt (Markdown Body)

The **workflow prompt** is the main markdown content that describes what you want the agent to do. This is the natural language task description.

- **Location**: The main body of the `.md` file (below the frontmatter)
- **Purpose**: Describes the task for the AI agent to execute
- **Editing**: Can be edited directly from the GitHub web interface without recompilation
- **Example**:
  ```markdown
  Triage the issue by analyzing its content, assigning appropriate labels,
  and adding a comment with your analysis.
  ```

> [!TIP]
> You can edit the workflow prompt directly through the GitHub web interface in your repository's `.github/workflows/*.md` files. Changes to the prompt take effect immediately in the next workflow run - no compilation needed.

### Frontmatter Configuration

The **frontmatter** is the YAML configuration block at the top of the workflow file that defines triggers, tools, permissions, and other settings.

- **Location**: Between `---` delimiters at the top of the `.md` file
- **Purpose**: Configures how the workflow runs (triggers, tools, permissions, etc.)
- **Editing**: **Requires recompilation** after manual changes
- **Example**:
  ```yaml
  ---
  engine: copilot
  on:
    issues:
      types: [opened]
  tools:
    github:
      toolsets: [issues]
  ---
  ```

> [!WARNING]
> After manually editing frontmatter configuration, you **must recompile** the workflow to regenerate the `.lock.yml` file:
> ```bash
> gh aw compile workflow-name.md
> ```
> The `.lock.yml` file is the compiled GitHub Actions workflow that actually runs. Changes to frontmatter won't take effect until you recompile and commit the updated `.lock.yml` file.
> 
> **Recommended**: Use the `/agent agentic-workflows` command instead, which handles recompilation automatically.

### Quick Reference

| What you're editing | Needs recompilation? | What it affects |
|---------------------|---------------------|-----------------|
| Markdown body (prompt) | ❌ No | The task description the agent receives |
| Frontmatter (YAML config) | ✅ Yes | Triggers, tools, permissions, and workflow settings |

## After Compiling

Commit the generated files ([`.lock.yml`](/gh-aw/reference/glossary/#workflow-lock-file-lockyml), the compiled GitHub Actions workflow file) if they are part of the project's tracked artifacts. The project uses compiled workflows in version control.
