All sample workflows on this site are part of the [Agentics collection](https://github.com/githubnext/agentics) - a comprehensive set of demonstrator agentic workflows that showcase the capabilities of GitHub Agentic Workflows for various automation scenarios.

> **GitHub Agentic Workflows is a research demonstrator from [GitHub Next](https://githubnext.com/) and [Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/research-software-engineering-rise/).** It is in early development and may change significantly. Using agentic workflows requires careful attention to security considerations and human supervision. Use with caution and at your own risk.
> These are demonstrator workflows for experimental use. Review all outputs carefully and use time-limited trials to evaluate effectiveness for your team.
