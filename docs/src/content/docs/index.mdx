## ✨ AI-Powered Repository Automation

GitHub Agentic Workflows combines the power of AI agents with GitHub's collaboration platform to enable [Continuous AI](https://githubnext.com/projects/continuous-ai) — the systematic, automated application of AI to software collaboration.

Run natural language workflows that can understand context, make decisions, and take meaningful actions across your repositories.

## 🔧 How It Works

GitHub Agentic Workflows transforms natural language markdown files into GitHub Actions that are executed by AI agents. Here's a simple example:

```markdown
---
on:
  issues:
    types: [opened]
permissions: read-all 
safe-outputs:
  add-comment:
---
# Issue Clarifier

Analyze the current issue and ask for additional details if the issue is unclear.
```

The `gh aw` cli compiles this into a GitHub Actions Workflow (.yml) that runs an AI agent (Claude, Codex, ...) in a containerized environment whenever a new issue is opened in the repository.

The AI agent reads your repository context, understands the issue content, and takes appropriate actions - all defined in natural language rather than complex code.

**Security Benefits:** Workflows use read-only permissions by default, with write operations only allowed through sanitized `safe-outputs`. Access can be gated to team members only, ensuring AI agents operate within controlled boundaries.

## 🔥 Key Features

- **Natural Language Workflows**: Write automation in markdown instead of complex YAML
- **AI-Powered Decision Making**: Workflows that understand context and adapt to situations
- **GitHub Integration**: Deep integration with issues, PRs, discussions, and repository management
- **Security First**: Sandboxed execution with minimal permissions and safe output processing
- **Multiple AI Engines**: Support for Claude, Codex, and custom AI processors

## 🎭 Ode to GitHub Agentic Workflows

:::note[A Community Tribute]
The following poem was contributed by the community, celebrating the innovative concepts and capabilities of GitHub Agentic Workflows.
:::

> In the realm where code and AI collide,  
> Where markdown files with YAML frontmatter reside,  
> A workflow awakens with natural speech,  
> Where human intent and automation reach.
>
> With triple dashes wrapping configuration's core,  
> Permissions and triggers—what tools to explore,  
> The engine awaits: Copilot, Claude, or more,  
> To parse your prose and open every door.
>
> From issue triage to pull request reviews,  
> From weekly reports to gathering news,  
> The agent reads your words so plain,  
> And turns intentions into GitHub's domain.
>
> MCP servers standing at the ready,  
> Tools of github, playwright, holding steady,  
> Safe outputs guard the write operations true,  
> While edit and bash bring changes through.
>
> `needs.activation.outputs.text` sanitized and clean,  
> Protecting from injection, unseen and mean,  
> Context expressions weave through every line,  
> `${{ github.repository }}` makes it shine.
>
> From `.md` to `.lock.yml` it compiles with grace,  
> Each import merged, each tool in place,  
> The agent ponders, iterates, creates,  
> While timeout_minutes seals its fate.
>
> So raise a toast to workflows agentic and bright,  
> Where natural language guides the automated flight,  
> In githubnext/gh-aw, the future we see—  
> Where AI and humans work in harmony.

> **GitHub Agentic Workflows is a research demonstrator from [GitHub Next](https://githubnext.com/) and [Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/research-software-engineering-rise/).** It is in early development and may change significantly. Using agentic workflows requires careful attention to security considerations and human supervision. Use with caution and at your own risk.
> These are demonstrator workflows for experimental use. Review all outputs carefully and use time-limited trials to evaluate effectiveness for your team.
