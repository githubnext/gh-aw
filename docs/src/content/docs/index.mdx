## What are GitHub Agentic Workflows?

GitHub Agentic Workflows enable AI agents to perform complex, multi-step tasks in your repository automatically. They combine the power of AI with GitHub's collaboration platform to enable **Continuous AI** — the systematic, automated application of AI to software collaboration.

	<Card title="Natural Language Instructions" icon="pencil">
		Write workflows in markdown with natural language instructions instead of complex code.
	</Card>
	<Card title="AI-Powered Automation" icon="rocket">
		AI agents understand context, make decisions, and take actions based on repository activity.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Secure by Design" icon="shield">
		Read-only permissions by default with write operations through sanitized safe-outputs.
	</Card>
	<Card title="GitHub Actions Integration" icon="github">
		Built on top of GitHub Actions with familiar triggers, permissions, and workflow syntax.
	</Card>
</CardGrid>

## How It Works

Transform natural language workflows into GitHub Actions that are executed by AI agents:

```markdown
---
on:
  issues:
    types: [opened]
permissions: read-all 
safe-outputs:
  add-issue-comment:
---
# Issue Clarifier

Analyze the current issue and ask for additional details if the issue is unclear.
```

The `gh aw` CLI compiles this into a GitHub Actions workflow that runs an AI agent (Claude, Codex, etc.) whenever a new issue is opened.
