## âœ¨ AI-Powered Repository Automation

GitHub Agentic Workflows combines the power of AI agents with GitHub's collaboration platform to enable [Continuous AI](https://githubnext.com/projects/continuous-ai) â€” the systematic, automated application of AI to software collaboration.

Run natural language workflows that can understand context, make decisions, and take meaningful actions across your repositories.

## ðŸ”§ How It Works

GitHub Agentic Workflows transforms natural language markdown files into GitHub Actions that are executed by AI agents. Here's a simple example:

```markdown
---
on:
  issues:
    types: [opened]
permissions: read-all 
safe-outputs:
  add-issue-comment:
---
# Issue Clarifier

Analyze the current issue and ask for additional details if the issue is unclear.
```

The `gh aw` cli compiles this into a GitHub Actions Workflow (.yml) that runs an AI agent (Claude, Codex, ...) in a containerized environment whenever a new issue is opened in the repository.

The AI agent reads your repository context, understands the issue content, and takes appropriate actions - all defined in natural language rather than complex code.

**Security Benefits:** Workflows use read-only permissions by default, with write operations only allowed through sanitized `safe-outputs`. Access can be gated to team members only, ensuring AI agents operate within controlled boundaries.

All sample workflows on this site are part of the [Agentics collection](https://github.com/githubnext/agentics) - a comprehensive set of demonstrator agentic workflows that showcase the capabilities of GitHub Agentic Workflows for various automation scenarios.

> **GitHub Agentic Workflows is a research demonstrator from [GitHub Next](https://githubnext.com/) and [Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/research-software-engineering-rise/).** It is in early development and may change significantly. Using agentic workflows requires careful attention to security considerations and human supervision. Use with caution and at your own risk.
> These are demonstrator workflows for experimental use. Review all outputs carefully and use time-limited trials to evaluate effectiveness for your team.
