## What is GitHub Agentic Workflows?

GitHub Agentic Workflows (gh-aw) is a GitHub CLI extension that lets you write AI-powered automation workflows in plain English using markdown files. These workflows run on GitHub Actions and can make intelligent decisions about your repository.

**Key features:**
- Write workflows in natural language markdown
- AI agents execute tasks with reasoning and decision-making
- Runs securely on GitHub Actions infrastructure
- Built-in safety controls and pre-approved actions

## What are Agentic Workflows?

**Agentic workflows** are AI-powered automation that can understand context, make decisions, and take meaningful actions—all from natural language instructions you write in markdown.

Unlike traditional automation with fixed if-then rules, agentic workflows use AI agents (like GitHub Copilot) to:
- **Understand context**: Read your repository, issues, and pull requests to grasp the current situation
- **Make decisions**: Choose appropriate actions based on the context, not just predefined conditions
- **Adapt behavior**: Respond flexibly to different scenarios without requiring explicit programming for each case

For example, instead of writing complex scripts to triage issues, you simply describe what you want: "Analyze this issue and ask for clarification if details are missing." The AI agent reads the issue, understands what information is needed, and generates an appropriate response.

**From this** (natural language):
```markdown
When an issue is opened, analyze it and ask for 
clarification if important details are missing.
```

**To automated action**: The AI reads the issue, determines what's missing, and posts a helpful comment requesting specific information—adapting its response to each unique issue.

This is "agentic" because the AI acts as an intelligent agent with agency to make context-aware decisions, rather than just executing predefined steps.
