## What is GitHub Agentic Workflows?

GitHub Agentic Workflows brings AI-powered decision-making to your automation. The term "agentic" means the AI acts as an intelligent agent that can analyze context, make decisions, and take appropriate actions—rather than just following fixed instructions.

### How is this different from GitHub Actions?

Traditional GitHub Actions execute predefined steps in sequence. You specify exactly what to do in every situation: "if label is bug, add comment X; if label is feature, add comment Y." This requires anticipating every scenario and writing explicit rules for each one.

Agentic workflows work differently. You describe the desired outcome in natural language, and the AI agent determines how to achieve it. The agent reads your repository context, understands the situation, and decides what actions to take. For example, instead of writing rules for every possible issue type, you simply write: "Analyze this issue and ask for clarification if details are missing." The AI understands what makes a good issue description and adapts its response to each unique situation.

### Example: Automated Issue Triage

**Traditional GitHub Actions approach:**
```yaml
if: contains(github.event.issue.body, 'steps to reproduce')
  run: echo "Issue looks complete"
else:
  run: echo "Please add steps to reproduce"
```
This only checks for specific text and can't understand context or nuance.

**Agentic workflow approach:**
```aw
When an issue is opened, analyze it and ask for 
clarification if important details are missing.
```
The AI agent reads the entire issue, understands what information is needed for that specific type of problem, and generates a contextual response—adapting to each unique situation without explicit rules.
