The `sandbox` field configures sandbox environments for AI engines (coding agents), providing two main capabilities:

1. **Coding Agent Sandbox** - Controls the agent runtime security using AWF (Agent Workflow Firewall)
2. **Model Context Protocol (MCP) Gateway** - Routes MCP server calls through a unified HTTP gateway

## Configuration

### Coding Agent Sandbox

Configure the coding agent sandbox type to control how the AI engine is isolated:

```yaml wrap
# Use AWF (Agent Workflow Firewall) - default
sandbox:
  agent: awf

# Disable coding agent sandbox - requires an operator-authored justification
features:
  dangerously-disable-sandbox-agent: "controlled environment with no internet access"
sandbox:
  agent: false

# Or omit sandbox entirely to use the default (awf)
```

**Default Behavior**

If `sandbox` is not specified in your workflow, it defaults to `sandbox.agent: awf`. The coding agent sandbox is recommended for all workflows.

**Disabling Coding Agent Sandbox**

Setting `sandbox.agent: false` disables the agent firewall while keeping the MCP gateway enabled. This removes a trust boundary and should only be used when strictly necessary.

To disable the agent sandbox, you **must** add `features.dangerously-disable-sandbox-agent` with a literal justification string of at least 20 characters. The justification must explain why the trust boundary is being removed and is stored for diagnostics and audit. The following values are rejected by the compiler:

- Boolean `true` — no longer accepted as a legacy shorthand
- Expressions such as `${{ inputs.reason }}` — must be a static literal
- Strings shorter than 20 characters after trimming whitespace

```yaml wrap
features:
  dangerously-disable-sandbox-agent: "controlled environment with no internet access"
sandbox:
  agent: false
```

> [!WARNING]
> Disabling the agent sandbox removes a security trust boundary. The `dangerously-disable-sandbox-agent` value is a permanent, reviewable record of why this workflow runs without the agent firewall. Write a reason that will be meaningful to future reviewers.

### Runtime Profiles

`sandbox.agent.runtime` is the single selector for the sandbox security and topology profile. Each value resolves to one supported combination of container runtime, AWF privileges, and host access:

| Runtime | Effective behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `docker` (default) | Default Docker runtime, rootless AWF, network isolation |
| `docker-sudo-iptables` | Docker with privileged AWF, legacy `iptables` networking, and host/service access |
| `gvisor` | gVisor with strict network isolation |
| `docker-sbx` | KVM microVM; the compiler handles the required privileged setup |
| `cloud-hypervisor` | Preview KVM runtime with its required privileged launcher |

Omitting `runtime` is equivalent to `runtime: docker`, which keeps the secure default.

Use the [security profile matrix](/gh-aw/reference/security-profiles/) to check runtime prerequisites and compatibility with GitHub access, services, host ports, and MCP exposure.

```yaml wrap
sandbox:
  agent:
    runtime: docker-sudo-iptables
    allow-host-ports: [9000]
```

The compiler derives every privilege the selected runtime needs, including the `sudo` used by the gVisor and Docker sbx installation steps. Unsupported combinations — such as `allow-host-ports` outside `docker-sudo-iptables`, or `runtime-install` outside `gvisor` and `docker-sbx` — fail at compile time. See [Agent Runtimes](/gh-aw/reference/agent-runtimes/) for runner prerequisites.

### MCP Gateway (Experimental)

Route MCP server calls through a unified HTTP gateway:

```yaml wrap
features:
  mcp-gateway: true

sandbox:
  mcp:
    port: 8080
    api-key: "${{ secrets.MCP_GATEWAY_API_KEY }}"
```

### Combined Configuration

Use both coding agent sandbox and MCP gateway together:

```yaml wrap
features:
  mcp-gateway: true

sandbox:
  agent: awf
  mcp:
    port: 8080
```

## Coding Agent Sandbox Types

### AWF (Agent Workflow Firewall)

AWF is the default coding agent sandbox that provides network egress control through domain-based access controls. Network permissions are configured through the top-level [`network`](/gh-aw/reference/network/) field.

```yaml wrap
sandbox:
  agent: awf

network:
  firewall: true
  allowed:
    - defaults
    - python
    - "api.example.com"
```

#### Filesystem Access

AWF makes the host filesystem visible inside the container with appropriate permissions:

| Path Type | Mode | Examples |
|-----------|------|----------|
| User paths | Read-write | `$HOME`, `$GITHUB_WORKSPACE`, `/tmp` |
| System paths | Read-only | `/usr`, `/opt`, `/bin`, `/lib` |
| Docker socket | Hidden | `/var/run/docker.sock` (security) |

#### Host Binaries

All host binaries are available without explicit mounts: system utilities, `gh`, language runtimes, build tools, and anything installed via `apt-get` or setup actions. Verify with `which <tool>`.

> [!WARNING]
> Docker socket is hidden for security. Agents cannot spawn containers.

#### Host Service Ports (`services:`)

The AWF sandbox reaches GitHub Actions `services:` containers through `--allow-host-service-ports`, which resolves each service's actual (possibly dynamically assigned) host port at runtime. This mechanism, and the explicit `allow-host-ports` escape hatch below, both require `sandbox.agent.runtime: docker-sudo-iptables`: the default (strict) runtime profile does not provide a route to host services, even when host-access flags are combined.

```yaml wrap
sandbox:
  agent:
    runtime: docker-sudo-iptables

services:
  postgres:
    image: postgres:18
    ports:
      - 5432:5432
```

For host daemons that are not declared in `services:`, add an explicit allowlist (also `docker-sudo-iptables` only):

```yaml wrap
sandbox:
  agent:
    runtime: docker-sudo-iptables
    allow-host-ports: [9000]
```

Use `allow-host-ports` only for ports that cannot be represented by `services:`. The compiler rejects values outside the TCP port range `1` through `65535`, and rejects ports AWF always blocks as dangerous (e.g. `22`, `3306`, `5432`, `6379`, `9200`) — reach those through `services:` instead.

#### Environment Variables

AWF passes all environment variables via `--env-all`. The host `PATH` is captured as `AWF_HOST_PATH` and restored inside the container, preserving setup action tool paths.

> [!NOTE]
> Go's "trimmed" binaries require `GOROOT` - AWF automatically captures it after `actions/setup-go`.

#### Runtime Tools

Setup actions work transparently. Runtimes update `PATH`, which AWF captures and restores inside the container.

```yaml wrap
---
jobs:
  setup:
    steps:
      - uses: actions/setup-go@v5
        with:
          go-version: '1.25'
      - uses: actions/setup-python@v5
        with:
          python-version: '3.12'
---

Use `go build` or `python3` - both are available.
```

#### Memory Limit (`sandbox.agent.memory`)

By default, AWF uses its own built-in memory limit for the agent container. Set `sandbox.agent.memory` to override this limit on large-memory runners:

```yaml wrap
sandbox:
  agent:
    memory: 8g
```

Valid values are a positive integer followed by a unit: `b`, `k`, `m`, or `g` (case-insensitive). Examples: `512m`, `4g`, `8g`, `1024m`.

When omitted, AWF's own default memory limit applies. Specifying an invalid format (e.g., `48gb` or `48`) is rejected at compile time.

> [!NOTE]
> Exit code 137 means the process received `SIGKILL`. A memory limit can be one cause, but verify with logs before changing `memory`. If you increase `memory`, leave headroom for the runner OS and other processes.

#### Token steering (`sandbox.agent.token-steering`)

AWF enables API proxy token steering by default. To keep the explicitly configured provider and model, disable it for a workflow:

```yaml wrap
sandbox:
  agent:
    token-steering: false
```

#### Copilot BYOK request customization (`sandbox.agent.targets.copilot`)

When routing Copilot through a BYOK-compatible upstream behind the AWF proxy, you can attach custom headers, extra request body fields, and an explicit session identifier on upstream requests:

```yaml wrap
sandbox:
  agent:
    targets:
      copilot:
        extraHeaders:
          x-openrouter-title: my-workflow
          http-referer: https://github.com/${{ github.repository }}
        extraBodyFields:
          custom-field: custom-value
        sessionId: ${{ github.run_id }}
```

Use this for OpenAI-compatible proxies and gateways that expect additional request metadata. `sessionId` is opt-in only; gh-aw does not derive it automatically.

> [!NOTE]
> Set `sessionId` only when your upstream expects a session identifier. Some strict OpenAI-compatible providers reject unknown `session_id` fields, so automatic injection would be unsafe.

#### Go cache paths in AWF (`GOMODCACHE` / `GOCACHE`)

When using `actions/setup-go` in AWF, pin Go cache paths explicitly so restore behavior is predictable:

```yaml wrap
jobs:
  setup:
    steps:
      - uses: actions/setup-go@v5
        with:
          go-version: '1.25'
          cache: false
      - run: |
          echo "GOMODCACHE=$HOME/go/pkg/mod" >> "$GITHUB_ENV"
          echo "GOCACHE=$HOME/.cache/go-build" >> "$GITHUB_ENV"
```

Then cache those paths via top-level `cache:` (see [Frontmatter cache configuration](/gh-aw/reference/frontmatter/)). Keep cache keys scoped to trusted contexts and avoid sharing writeable keys between untrusted and protected runs.

## MCP Gateway

The MCP Gateway routes all MCP server calls through a unified HTTP gateway, enabling centralized management, logging, and authentication for MCP tools.

## Feature Flags

Some sandbox features require feature flags:

| Feature | Flag | Description |
|---------|------|-------------|
| MCP Gateway | `mcp-gateway` | Enable MCP gateway routing |

Enable feature flags in your workflow:

```yaml wrap
features:
  mcp-gateway: true
```

## Long Build Times

Repositories with lengthy build or test cycles — C++ codebases, large monorepos, or complex integration suites — can exhaust the default 20-minute job timeout or hit individual tool-call time limits. This section describes how to tune those limits.

### Setting the Job Timeout (`timeout-minutes`)

The `timeout-minutes` frontmatter field sets the maximum wall-clock time for the entire agent job. The default is 20 minutes. For repositories where a full build or test run takes 10 minutes or more, increase this value:

```yaml wrap
---
on: issues

timeout-minutes: 60   # 60-minute budget for the agent job
---

Fix the failing test in the C++ core library.
```

**Recommended values by repository type:**

| Repository type | Typical build time | Suggested `timeout-minutes` |
|-----------------|-------------------|------------------------------|
| Small (scripts, docs) | < 2 min | 20 (default) |
| Medium (Go, Python, Node) | 2–10 min | 30–60 |
| Large (C++, Rust, Java monorepo) | 10–30 min | 60–120 |
| Very large (distributed, full CI) | > 30 min | 120–360 |

GitHub Actions enforces a hard upper limit of 360 minutes (6 hours) for a single job.

`timeout-minutes` also accepts a GitHub Actions expression, making it easy to parameterize in `workflow_call` reusable workflows:

```yaml wrap
on:
  workflow_call:
    inputs:
      job-timeout:
        type: number
        default: 60

---

timeout-minutes: ${{ inputs.job-timeout }}
```

### Concrete Example: 30-Minute Timeout for a C++ Repository

```yaml wrap
---
on:
  issues:
    types: [opened, labeled]

engine: copilot

runs-on: [self-hosted, linux, x64, large]   # fast self-hosted runner
timeout-minutes: 30                          # 30-minute agent budget

tools:
  bash: [":*"]
  timeout: 300                               # 5-minute per-tool-call budget

network:
  allowed:
    - defaults
    - go
    - node
---

Reproduce the bug described in this issue, add a regression test, and fix it.
Build with `cmake --build build -j$(nproc)` and verify with `ctest --output-on-failure`.
```

### Splitting Build and Test into Separate Steps

Instead of relying on a single large timeout, break long workflows into a custom `jobs:` setup step that caches build outputs, then runs the agent on the pre-built workspace:

```yaml wrap
---
on: issues

timeout-minutes: 45

jobs:
  setup:
    steps:
      - name: Restore build cache
        uses: actions/cache@v4
        with:
          path: build/
          key: cpp-build-${{ hashFiles('CMakeLists.txt', 'src/**') }}
          restore-keys: cpp-build-
      - name: Build (if cache miss)
        run: |
          cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
          cmake --build build -j$(nproc)
      - name: Save build cache
        uses: actions/cache/save@v4
        with:
          path: build/
          key: cpp-build-${{ hashFiles('CMakeLists.txt', 'src/**') }}
---

The build artifacts are already in `build/`. Run the failing tests with
`ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure -R <pattern>` and fix any failures.
```

Pre-building in a setup job ensures the agent's `timeout-minutes` budget is spent on analysis and code changes, not waiting for compilation.

### Per-Tool-Call Timeout (`tools.timeout`)

`tools.timeout` controls the maximum time for any single tool invocation (e.g., a `bash` command or MCP server call), in seconds. Increase this when individual commands — such as a full build or a slow test suite — routinely take longer than the engine default:

```yaml wrap
tools:
  timeout: 600   # 10 minutes per tool call (seconds)
```

Default values vary by engine: Claude uses 60 s, Codex uses 120 s. See [Tool Timeout Configuration](/gh-aw/reference/tools/#tool-timeout-configuration) for details.

### Self-Hosted Runners for Fast Hardware

For repositories where build time exceeds 10 minutes on standard GitHub-hosted runners, self-hosted runners with more CPU cores, faster storage, and pre-warmed dependency caches can dramatically reduce wall-clock time:

```yaml wrap
---
on: issues

runs-on: [self-hosted, linux, x64, large]   # 32-core self-hosted runner
timeout-minutes: 30
---

Run the full test suite and fix any failures.
```

See [Self-Hosted Runners](/gh-aw/reference/self-hosted-runners/) for setup instructions, including Docker and `sudo` requirements.

### Caching Build Artifacts Between Runs

Use `actions/cache` in a custom `jobs.setup` block to persist build artifacts across agentic runs. This avoids redundant compilation and keeps the agent job within tighter time budgets:

```yaml wrap
---
on: issues

timeout-minutes: 30

jobs:
  setup:
    steps:
      - uses: actions/cache@v4
        with:
          path: |
            ~/.gradle/caches
            build/
          key: gradle-${{ hashFiles('**/*.gradle*') }}
          restore-keys: gradle-
      - run: ./gradlew build -x test --parallel
---

Review the failing tests and apply a fix. Build artifacts are pre-cached.
```
