This glossary provides definitions for key technical terms and concepts used in GitHub Agentic Workflows.

## Core Concepts

### Agentic Workflow
An AI-powered workflow that can reason, make decisions, and take autonomous actions using natural language instructions. Unlike traditional workflows with fixed if/then rules, agentic workflows interpret context and adapt their behavior based on the situation they encounter.

### Agent
The AI system (typically GitHub Copilot CLI) that executes natural language instructions in an agentic workflow. The agent interprets tasks, uses available tools, and generates outputs based on context.

### Frontmatter
The configuration section at the top of a workflow file, enclosed between `---` markers. Contains YAML settings that control when the workflow runs, what permissions it has, and what tools it can use. Separates technical configuration from natural language instructions.

```yaml
---
on: issues
permissions: read-all
tools:
  github:
---
```

### Compilation
The process of translating Markdown workflows (`.md` files) into GitHub Actions YAML format (`.lock.yml` files). During compilation, workflows are validated, imports are resolved, tools are configured, and security hardening is applied.

### Workflow Lock File (.lock.yml)
The compiled GitHub Actions workflow file generated from a workflow markdown file (`.md`). Contains complete GitHub Actions YAML with security hardening applied. Both the `.md` source file and `.lock.yml` compiled file should be committed to version control. GitHub Actions runs the lock file, while the `.md` file remains easy to read and edit.

## Tools and Integration

### MCP (Model Context Protocol)
A standardized protocol that allows AI agents to securely connect to external tools, databases, and services. MCP enables workflows to integrate with GitHub APIs, web services, file systems, and custom integrations while maintaining security controls.

### MCP Server
A service that implements the Model Context Protocol to provide specific capabilities to AI agents. Examples include the GitHub MCP server (for GitHub API operations), Playwright MCP server (for browser automation), or custom MCP servers for specialized tools.

### Tools
Capabilities that an AI agent can use during workflow execution. Tools are configured in the frontmatter and include GitHub operations (`github:`), file editing (`edit:`), web access (`web-fetch:`, `web-search:`), shell commands (`bash:`), browser automation (`playwright:`), and custom MCP servers.

## Security and Outputs

### Safe Inputs
Custom MCP tools defined inline in the workflow frontmatter using JavaScript or shell scripts. Allows lightweight tool creation without external dependencies while maintaining controlled access to secrets. Tools are generated at runtime and mounted as an MCP server. Each tool can have typed input parameters, default values, and environment variables. Configured using the `safe-inputs:` section in frontmatter.

### Safe Outputs
Pre-approved actions the AI can take without requiring elevated permissions. The AI generates structured output describing what it wants to create (issues, comments, pull requests), which is processed by separate, permission-controlled jobs. Configured using the `safe-outputs:` section in frontmatter. This approach lets AI agents create GitHub content without direct write access, reducing security risks.

### Staged Mode
A preview mode where workflows simulate their actions without making changes. The AI generates output showing what would happen, but no GitHub API write operations are performed. Use for testing and validation before running workflows in production.

### Permissions
Access controls that define what operations a workflow can perform. Workflows follow the principle of least privilege, starting with read-only access by default. Write operations are typically handled through safe outputs rather than direct permissions.

### Safe Output Messages
Customizable messages that workflows can display during execution to communicate status and progress. Configured in the `safe-outputs.messages` section. Types include `run-started` (workflow begins), `run-success` (workflow completes successfully), `run-failure` (workflow fails), and `footer` (appended to all safe outputs). Supports GitHub context variables like `{workflow_name}` and `{run_url}`.

```yaml
safe-outputs:
  messages:
    run-started: "🔍 Analysis starting! [{workflow_name}]({run_url})"
    run-success: "✅ Analysis complete!"
    footer: "> 🤖 *Generated by [{workflow_name}]({run_url})*"
```

### Upload Assets
A safe output capability that allows workflows to upload files and artifacts without requiring write permissions. Configured in the `safe-outputs.upload-assets` section. The AI generates structured output describing files to upload, which are processed by a separate, permission-controlled job.

```yaml
safe-outputs:
  upload-assets:
```

## Workflow Components

### Engine
The AI system that powers the agentic workflow. GitHub Agentic Workflows supports multiple engines:
- **GitHub Copilot** (default): Uses GitHub's coding assistant

### Triggers
Events that cause a workflow to run. Defined in the `on:` section of frontmatter. Includes issue events (`issues:`), pull request events (`pull_request:`), scheduled runs (`schedule:`), manual runs (`workflow_dispatch:`), and comment commands (`command:`).

### Cron Schedule
A time-based trigger format using standard cron syntax with five fields: minute, hour, day of month, month, and day of week.

```yaml
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: "0 9 * * 1"  # Every Monday at 9 AM UTC
```

### workflow_dispatch
A manual trigger that runs a workflow on demand from the GitHub Actions UI or via the GitHub API. Requires explicit user initiation.

```yaml
on: workflow_dispatch
```

### Network Permissions
Controls over what external domains and services a workflow can access. Configured using the `network:` section in frontmatter. Options: `defaults` (common development infrastructure), custom allow-lists (specific domains), or `{}` (no network access).

### Imports
Reusable workflow components that can be shared across multiple workflows. Specified in the `imports:` field. Can include tool configurations, common instructions, or security guidelines stored in separate files.

## GitHub and Infrastructure Terms

### GitHub Actions
GitHub's built-in automation platform that runs workflows in response to repository events. Agentic workflows compile to GitHub Actions YAML format, leveraging the existing infrastructure for execution, permissions, and secrets management.

### GitHub Actions Secret
A secure, encrypted variable stored in repository or organization settings. Holds sensitive values like API keys or tokens. Access in workflows using `${{ secrets.SECRET_NAME }}` syntax.

### YAML
A human-friendly data format used for configuration files. Uses indentation and simple syntax to represent structured data. In agentic workflows, YAML appears in the frontmatter section and in compiled `.lock.yml` files.

### Personal Access Token (PAT)
A token that authenticates you to GitHub's APIs with specific permissions. Required for GitHub Copilot CLI to access Copilot services. Created at github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens.

### Agent Files
Markdown files with YAML frontmatter stored in `.github/agents/` that define interactive Copilot Chat agents. Created by `gh aw init`, these files (like `create-agentic-workflow.agent.md`) can be invoked with the `/agent` command in Copilot Chat to guide workflow creation with specialized instructions.

### Fine-grained Personal Access Token
A type of GitHub Personal Access Token with granular permission control. Specify exactly which repositories the token can access and what permissions it has (`contents: read`, `issues: write`, etc.). Created at github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens.

## Development and Compilation

### CLI (Command Line Interface)
The `gh-aw` extension for the GitHub CLI (`gh`) that provides commands for managing agentic workflows: `gh aw compile` (compile workflows), `gh aw run` (trigger runs), `gh aw status` (check status), `gh aw logs` (download and analyze logs), and `gh aw add` (add workflows from repositories).

### Validation
The process of checking workflow files for errors, security issues, and best practices. Occurs during compilation and can be enhanced with strict mode and security scanners (actionlint, zizmor, poutine).

## Advanced Features

### Cache Memory
Persistent storage for workflows that preserves data between runs. Configured using `cache-memory:` in the tools section, it enables workflows to remember information and build on previous interactions.

### Command Triggers
Special triggers that respond to slash commands in issue and PR comments (e.g., `/review`, `/deploy`). Configured using the `command:` section with a command name.

### Concurrency Control
Settings that limit how many instances of a workflow can run simultaneously. Configured using the `concurrency:` field to prevent resource conflicts or rate limiting.

### Environment Variables (env)
Configuration section in frontmatter that defines environment variables for the workflow. Variables can reference GitHub context values, workflow inputs, or static values. Accessible to all workflow steps via `${{ env.VARIABLE_NAME }}` syntax.

```yaml
env:
  ORGANIZATION: ${{ github.event.inputs.organization || 'github' }}
  API_VERSION: v3
```

### Custom Agents
Specialized instructions or configurations that customize AI agent behavior for specific tasks or repositories. Can be stored as:
- **Agent files** (`.github/agents/*.agent.md`) - Used with Copilot Chat `/agent` command for interactive workflow authoring and execution-time customization
- **Instruction files** (`.github/copilot/instructions/`) - Path-specific or repository-wide Copilot instructions

### Strict Mode
An enhanced validation mode that enforces additional security checks and best practices. Enabled using `strict: true` in frontmatter or the `--strict` flag when compiling.

### Timeout
The maximum duration a workflow can run before being automatically cancelled. Configured using `timeout-minutes:` in frontmatter. Default GitHub Actions timeout is 360 minutes (6 hours); workflows can specify shorter timeouts to fail faster.

```yaml
timeout-minutes: 45
```

### Toolsets
Predefined collections of related MCP tools that can be enabled together. Used with the GitHub MCP server to group capabilities like `repos` (repository operations), `issues` (issue operations), and `pull_requests` (PR operations). Configured in the `toolsets:` field under tool configuration.

```yaml
tools:
  github:
    toolsets:
      - repos
      - issues
```

### Workflow Inputs
Parameters that can be provided when manually triggering a workflow with `workflow_dispatch`. Defined in the `on.workflow_dispatch.inputs` section with type, description, default value, and whether the input is required.

```yaml
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      organization:
        description: "GitHub organization to scan"
        required: true
        type: string
        default: github
```
