The `safe-jobs:` element of your workflow's frontmatter enables you to define custom post-processing jobs that execute after the main agentic workflow completes. Safe-jobs provide a powerful way to create sophisticated automation workflows while maintaining security through controlled job execution.

**How It Works:**
1. Safe-jobs are defined as a top-level frontmatter property, completely independent from safe-outputs
2. Each safe-job **must have an "inputs" section with at least one input** - these inputs become the arguments of the MCP tool
3. Each safe-job has access to all standard GitHub Actions job properties (runs-on, if, needs, env, permissions, steps)
4. Safe-jobs automatically download the agent output artifact and can process it using jq
5. Safe-jobs become available as callable tools in the safe-outputs MCP server
6. Safe-jobs can be imported from included workflows with automatic conflict detection

**Important Requirement**: Every safe-job definition must include an `inputs` section with at least one input parameter. These inputs define the MCP tool's arguments and enable the agentic workflow to call the safe-job with appropriate parameters.

## Basic Usage

**Note**: All safe-jobs must have an `inputs` section with at least one input parameter.

on: issues
engine: claude
safe-jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    inputs:
      environment:
        description: "Target deployment environment"
        required: true
        type: choice
        options: ["staging", "production"]
    steps:
      - name: Deploy application
        run: |
          if [ -f "$GITHUB_AW_AGENT_OUTPUT" ]; then
            ENV=$(cat "$GITHUB_AW_AGENT_OUTPUT" | jq -r 'select(.tool == "deploy") | .environment // "staging"')
            echo "Deploying to $ENV based on agent analysis"
          fi

## Core Features

### GitHub Actions Job Properties

Safe-jobs support all standard GitHub Actions job properties:

```yaml
safe-jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: github.event.issue.number
    timeout-minutes: 30
    permissions:
      contents: write
      deployments: write
    env:
      DEPLOY_ENV: production
    inputs:
      confirm:
        description: "Confirm deployment"
        required: true
        type: boolean
        default: "false"
    steps:
      - name: Deploy
        run: echo "Deploying..."
```

### Workflow Dispatch Inputs (Required)

**Every safe-job must define inputs** using workflow_dispatch syntax for parameterization. The inputs become the MCP tool arguments:

```yaml
safe-jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    inputs:
      environment:
        description: "Target deployment environment"
        required: true
        type: choice
        options: ["staging", "production"]
      force:
        description: "Force deployment even if tests fail"
        required: false
        type: boolean
        default: "false"
    steps:
      - name: Deploy application
        run: |
          if [ -f "$GITHUB_AW_AGENT_OUTPUT" ]; then
            ENV=$(cat "$GITHUB_AW_AGENT_OUTPUT" | jq -r 'select(.tool == "deploy") | .environment // "staging"')
            echo "Deploying to $ENV"
          fi
```

### Custom Output Messages

Safe-jobs can return custom response messages via the MCP server:

```yaml
safe-jobs:
  notify:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    output: "Notification sent successfully!"
    steps:
      - name: Send notification
        run: echo "Sending notification..."
```

### Agent Output Processing

Safe-jobs automatically receive access to the agent output artifact:

```yaml
safe-jobs:
  analyze:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Process agent output
        run: |
          if [ -f "$GITHUB_AW_AGENT_OUTPUT" ]; then
            # Extract specific data from agent output
            RESULT=$(cat "$GITHUB_AW_AGENT_OUTPUT" | jq -r 'select(.tool == "analyze") | .result')
            echo "Agent analysis result: $RESULT"
          else
            echo "No agent output available"
          fi
```

## Include Support

Safe-jobs can be imported from included workflows with automatic conflict detection:

**Main workflow:**
```aw wrap
---
safe-jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Deploy
        run: echo "Deploying..."
---

@include shared/common-jobs.md
```

**Included file (shared/common-jobs.md):**
```aw wrap
---
safe-jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Test
        run: echo "Testing..."
---
```

**Result:** Both `deploy` and `test` safe-jobs are available.

**Conflict Detection:** If both files define a safe-job with the same name, compilation fails with:
```
failed to merge safe-jobs: safe-job name conflict: 'deploy' is defined in both main workflow and included files
```

## MCP Server Integration

Safe-jobs are automatically registered as tools in the safe-outputs MCP server, allowing the agentic workflow to call them:

```yaml
safe-jobs:
  database-backup:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    inputs:
      database:
        description: "Database to backup"
        required: true
        type: string
    steps:
      - name: Backup database
        run: echo "Backing up database..."
```

The agent can then call this safe-job:
```
Please backup the user database using the database-backup safe-job.
```

## Generated Workflow Structure

Safe-jobs compile to standard GitHub Actions jobs with automatic setup:

```yaml
deploy:
  needs: main-job
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  steps:
    - name: Download agent output artifact
      continue-on-error: true
      uses: actions/download-artifact@v5
      with:
        name: safe_output.jsonl
        path: /tmp/safe-jobs/
    - name: Setup Safe Job Environment Variables
      run: |
        echo "GITHUB_AW_AGENT_OUTPUT=/tmp/safe-jobs/safe_output.jsonl" >> $GITHUB_ENV
    - name: Deploy application
      run: |
        if [ -f "$GITHUB_AW_AGENT_OUTPUT" ]; then
          ENV=$(cat "$GITHUB_AW_AGENT_OUTPUT" | jq -r 'select(.tool == "deploy") | .environment // "staging"')
          echo "Deploying to $ENV"
        fi
```

## Best Practices

### Security
- Use minimal required permissions for each safe-job
- Validate agent output before processing
- Use `continue-on-error: true` for artifact downloads to handle missing outputs gracefully

### Data Processing
- Always check if `$GITHUB_AW_AGENT_OUTPUT` exists before processing
- Use jq filters to extract specific data from agent output
- Provide fallback values for missing data

### Organization
- Group related safe-jobs in shared include files
- Use descriptive names for safe-jobs to avoid conflicts
- Document input requirements clearly

### Performance
- Set appropriate `timeout-minutes` for long-running jobs
- Use `if` conditions to control when safe-jobs execute
- Consider runner costs when choosing `runs-on` values

## Common Patterns

### Conditional Deployment
```yaml
safe-jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: contains(github.event.issue.labels.*.name, 'deploy')
    permissions:
      contents: write
    steps:
      - name: Deploy if requested
        run: |
          if [ -f "$GITHUB_AW_AGENT_OUTPUT" ]; then
            SHOULD_DEPLOY=$(cat "$GITHUB_AW_AGENT_OUTPUT" | jq -r 'select(.tool == "deploy") | .approved // false')
            if [ "$SHOULD_DEPLOY" = "true" ]; then
              echo "Deploying application..."
            else
              echo "Deployment not approved by agent"
            fi
          fi
```

### Multi-step Processing
```yaml
safe-jobs:
  process-results:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Extract data
        run: |
          if [ -f "$GITHUB_AW_AGENT_OUTPUT" ]; then
            cat "$GITHUB_AW_AGENT_OUTPUT" | jq -r '.[] | select(.type == "result")' > /tmp/results.json
          fi
      - name: Process data
        run: |
          if [ -f "/tmp/results.json" ]; then
            echo "Processing $(wc -l < /tmp/results.json) results"
          fi
      - name: Upload results
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: processed-results
          path: /tmp/results.json
```

### Error Handling
```yaml
safe-jobs:
  robust-task:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Safe processing
        run: |
          set -euo pipefail
          
          if [ ! -f "$GITHUB_AW_AGENT_OUTPUT" ]; then
            echo "Warning: No agent output found, using defaults"
            echo '{"status": "default"}' > /tmp/config.json
          else
            cp "$GITHUB_AW_AGENT_OUTPUT" /tmp/config.json
          fi
          
          # Process with error handling
          if ! jq -e '.status' /tmp/config.json > /dev/null; then
            echo "Error: Invalid agent output format"
            exit 1
          fi
          
          STATUS=$(jq -r '.status' /tmp/config.json)
          echo "Processing with status: $STATUS"
```

## Schema Validation

Safe-jobs configurations are validated against comprehensive JSON schemas that ensure:

- **GitHub Actions Compatibility**: All job properties follow GitHub Actions standards
- **Input Validation**: workflow_dispatch input syntax is properly structured  
- **Permission Validation**: Permissions follow GitHub's permission model
- **Step Validation**: Steps have required properties (uses or run) with proper types

Invalid configurations will show clear error messages during compilation:
```
safe-jobs.deploy.steps[0]: must have either 'uses' or 'run' property
safe-jobs.deploy.permissions.invalid-scope: must be one of [read, write, none]
```
