GitHub Agentic Workflows enable AI [agents](/gh-aw/reference/glossary/#agent) (autonomous AI systems that can make decisions) to perform complex, multi-step tasks automatically with your team. Built on [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions), they use [**GitHub Copilot**](/gh-aw/reference/engines/#github-copilot-cli) (or experimental engines like Claude and Codex) to interpret natural language instructions and enable [Continuous AI](https://githubnext.com/projects/continuous-ai) — systematic, automated application of AI to software collaboration.

## Workflow Structure

Each workflow contains YAML frontmatter (the configuration section between `---` markers) and markdown instructions. The frontmatter defines [triggers](/gh-aw/reference/triggers/), [permissions](/gh-aw/reference/permissions/), and [tools](/gh-aw/reference/tools/), while the markdown contains natural language task descriptions. This declarative structure enables reliable, secure agentic programming by sandboxing AI capabilities and triggering at the right moments.

## AI Engines

Workflows support **GitHub Copilot** (default), **Claude Code**, and **Codex**. Each [engine](/gh-aw/reference/engines/) interprets natural language instructions and executes them using configured tools and permissions.

## Tools and Model Context Protocol (MCP)

Workflows use [tools](/gh-aw/reference/tools/) through the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** — a standardized protocol for connecting AI agents to external tools and services — for GitHub operations, external APIs, file operations, and custom integrations.

## Agentic vs. Traditional Workflows

**Traditional workflows** execute pre-programmed steps with fixed if/then logic. They do exactly what you tell them, every time, in the same way.

**[Agentic workflows](/gh-aw/reference/glossary/#agentic)** use AI to understand context, make decisions, and generate content by interpreting natural language instructions flexibly. They combine deterministic GitHub Actions infrastructure with AI-driven decision-making, adapting their behavior based on the specific situation they encounter.

## Security Design

Agentic workflows implement a defense-in-depth security architecture that protects against prompt injection, rogue MCP servers, and malicious agents. The architecture operates across multiple layers: compilation-time validation, runtime isolation, permission separation, network controls, and output sanitization.

    COMPILE --> RUNTIME["⚙️ Runtime"]
    RUNTIME --> ISOLATION["🛡️ Isolation"]
    ISOLATION --> OUTPUT["📤 Output"]
    OUTPUT --> ACTIONS["✅ Actions"]
```

Workflows run with minimal permissions (no write access by default), use tool allowlists, and process outputs through a [safety layer](/gh-aw/guides/security/) before applying changes. Critical actions can require human approval. For detailed security documentation, see the [Security Architecture](/gh-aw/introduction/architecture/) page.

## Compilation

Use `gh aw compile` to generate `.lock.yml` files (compiled GitHub Actions workflow files) from workflow `.md` files. The `.md` file is the editable source of truth, while `.lock.yml` is the compiled GitHub Actions workflow with security hardening. Commit both files.

## Continuous AI Patterns

Enable [Continuous AI](https://githubnext.com/projects/continuous-ai) patterns like keeping documentation current, improving code quality incrementally, intelligently triaging issues and PRs, and automating code review.

## Best Practices

Start simple and iterate with clear, specific instructions. Test workflows using `gh aw compile --watch` and `gh aw run`, monitor costs with `gh aw logs`, and review AI-generated content before merging. Use [`safe outputs`](/gh-aw/reference/safe-outputs/) for controlled creation of issues, comments, and PRs.
