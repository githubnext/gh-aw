GitHub Agentic Workflows enable AI [agents](/gh-aw/reference/glossary/#agent) (autonomous AI systems that can make decisions) to perform complex, multi-step tasks automatically with your team. Built on [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions), they use [**GitHub Copilot**](/gh-aw/reference/engines/#github-copilot-cli) (or experimental engines like Claude and Codex) to interpret natural language instructions and enable [Continuous AI](https://githubnext.com/projects/continuous-ai) — systematic, automated application of AI to software collaboration.

## Workflow Lifecycle

The workflow lifecycle transforms natural language instructions into secure, executable automation:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph Write["① Write"]
        direction TB
        MD["📝 workflow.md"]
        DESC1["<small>Natural language<br/>instructions</small>"]
        MD ~~~ DESC1
    end
    
    subgraph Compile["② Compile"]
        direction TB
        CMD["⚙️ gh aw compile"]
        DESC2["<small>Validates config<br/>Applies security<br/>Pins actions</small>"]
        CMD ~~~ DESC2
    end
    
    subgraph Commit["③ Commit"]
        direction TB
        LOCK["📄 workflow.lock.yml"]
        DESC3["<small>GitHub Actions YAML<br/>with hardening</small>"]
        LOCK ~~~ DESC3
    end
    
    subgraph Execute["④ Execute"]
        direction TB
        GHA["🤖 AI Agent"]
        DESC4["<small>Runs on GitHub<br/>Actions runner</small>"]
        GHA ~~~ DESC4
    end
    
    subgraph Result["⑤ Result"]
        direction TB
        OPS["✅ GitHub Operations"]
        DESC5["<small>Issues, PRs,<br/>Comments</small>"]
        OPS ~~~ DESC5
    end
    
    MD --> CMD
    CMD --> LOCK
    LOCK --> GHA
    GHA --> OPS
    
    style Write fill:#e8f5e9
    style Compile fill:#fff3e0
    style Commit fill:#e3f2fd
    style Execute fill:#f3e5f5
    style Result fill:#e8f5e9
```

This compilation-based approach ensures that every workflow is validated for security before execution, with the `.md` file serving as the human-readable source and `.lock.yml` as the machine-executable output.

## Workflow Structure

Each workflow contains [frontmatter](/gh-aw/reference/glossary/#frontmatter) (YAML configuration section) and markdown instructions. The frontmatter defines [triggers](/gh-aw/reference/triggers/), [permissions](/gh-aw/reference/permissions/), and [tools](/gh-aw/reference/tools/), while the markdown contains natural language task descriptions. This declarative structure enables reliable, secure agentic programming by sandboxing AI capabilities and triggering at the right moments.

## AI Engines

Workflows support **GitHub Copilot** (default), **Claude Code**, and **Codex**. Each [engine](/gh-aw/reference/engines/) (AI model/provider) interprets natural language instructions and executes them using configured tools and permissions.

## Tools and Model Context Protocol (MCP)

Workflows use [tools](/gh-aw/reference/tools/) through the **[Model Context Protocol](/gh-aw/reference/glossary/#mcp-model-context-protocol)** (MCP, a standard for AI tool integration) — a standardized protocol for connecting AI agents to external tools and services — for GitHub operations, external APIs, file operations, and custom integrations.

## Agentic vs. Traditional Workflows

**Traditional workflows** execute pre-programmed steps with fixed if/then logic. They do exactly what you tell them, every time, in the same way.

**[Agentic workflows](/gh-aw/reference/glossary/#agentic)** use AI to understand context, make decisions, and generate content by interpreting natural language instructions flexibly. They combine deterministic GitHub Actions infrastructure with AI-driven decision-making, adapting their behavior based on the specific situation they encounter.

## Security Design

Agentic workflows implement a defense-in-depth security architecture that protects against prompt injection, rogue MCP servers, and malicious agents. The architecture operates across multiple layers: compilation-time validation, runtime isolation, permission separation, network controls, and output sanitization.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    INPUT["📥 Input"] --> COMPILE["🔒 Compile"]
    COMPILE --> RUNTIME["⚙️ Runtime"]
    RUNTIME --> ISOLATION["🛡️ Isolation"]
    ISOLATION --> OUTPUT["📤 Output"]
    OUTPUT --> ACTIONS["✅ Actions"]
```

Workflows run with minimal permissions (no write access by default), use tool allowlists, and process outputs through a [safety layer](/gh-aw/guides/security/) before applying changes. Critical actions can require human approval. For detailed security documentation, see the [Security Architecture](/gh-aw/introduction/architecture/) page.

## Safe Inputs and Safe Outputs

- **[Safe inputs](/gh-aw/reference/safe-inputs/)** (validated user input tools) — Custom MCP tools defined inline to prevent injection attacks
- **[Safe outputs](/gh-aw/reference/safe-outputs/)** (validated GitHub operations) — Pre-approved actions the AI can request without write permissions

## Compilation

Use `gh aw compile` to generate `.lock.yml` files (compiled GitHub Actions workflow files) from workflow `.md` files. The `.md` file is the editable source of truth, while `.lock.yml` is the compiled GitHub Actions workflow with security hardening. Commit both files.

## Continuous AI Patterns

Enable [Continuous AI](https://githubnext.com/projects/continuous-ai) patterns like keeping documentation current, improving code quality incrementally, intelligently triaging issues and PRs, and automating code review.

## Best Practices

Start simple and iterate with clear, specific instructions. Test workflows using `gh aw compile --watch` and `gh aw run`, monitor costs with `gh aw logs`, and review AI-generated content before merging. Use [`safe outputs`](/gh-aw/reference/safe-outputs/) (validated GitHub operations) for controlled creation of issues, comments, and PRs.
