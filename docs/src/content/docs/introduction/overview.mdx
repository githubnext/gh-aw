## Natural Language to GitHub Actions

Imagine describing your automation needs in plain language instead of wrestling with complex YAML syntax and API calls. GitHub Agentic Workflows makes this possible by transforming natural language markdown files into [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) that are executed by AI agents.

Instead of writing intricate scripts to handle issue triage, code reviews, or release management, you simply describe what you want to happen. The AI agent understands your repository context, interprets the situation, and takes appropriate actions—all from a few lines of markdown.

Here's a simple example:

```markdown wrap
---
on:
  issues:
    types: [opened]
permissions: read-all 
safe-outputs:
  add-comment:
---
# Issue Clarifier

Analyze the current issue and ask for additional details if the issue is unclear.
```

The `gh aw` cli compiles this into a [GitHub Actions Workflow](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/concepts/workflows-and-actions/workflows#about-workflows) (.yml) that runs an AI agent (Claude, Codex, ...) in a containerized environment whenever a new issue is opened in the repository.

The AI agent reads your repository context, understands the issue content, and takes appropriate actions - all defined in natural language rather than complex code.

Workflows use read-only permissions by default, with write operations only allowed through sanitized [`safe-outputs`](/gh-aw/reference/safe-outputs/). Access can be gated to team members only, ensuring AI agents operate within controlled boundaries.

More sample workflows can be found in the [Agentics collection](https://github.com/githubnext/agentics).
