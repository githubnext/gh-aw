## What are agentic campaigns?

Agentic campaigns coordinate AI agents across multiple workflow runs to achieve strategic goals. Think of them as project management for AI: clear objectives, measurable KPIs, and automated progress tracking through GitHub Projects.

**How it works:**
1. **Define** - Write a `.campaign.md` spec with objectives and worker workflows
2. **Compile** - Generate the orchestrator with `gh aw compile`
3. **Execute** - Agents work autonomously toward your goals
4. **Track** - GitHub Project board shows real-time progress

### Campaigns vs Workflows

| Agentic Workflow | Agentic Campaign |
|------------------|------------------|
| Executes single task | Coordinates multiple tasks toward a goal |
| Event-triggered or scheduled | Strategic initiative over time |
| Standalone automation | Orchestrated with shared progress tracking |
| Success/failure per run | Success measured by KPIs across runs |

## Why Use Campaigns?

<FeatureGrid columns={2}>
  <FeatureCard icon="goal" title="Strategic Goals" href="/gh-aw/guides/campaigns/specs/#core-fields-what-they-do">
    Define objectives with measurable KPIs that track progress automatically
  </FeatureCard>
  <FeatureCard icon="project" title="Unified Tracking" href="/gh-aw/guides/campaigns/project-management/">
    GitHub Project board shows all work items and real-time status
  </FeatureCard>
  <FeatureCard icon="shield" title="Built-in Governance" href="/gh-aw/guides/campaigns/specs/#governance-pacing--safety">
    Rate limits and safety controls keep automation predictable and safe

  <FeatureCard icon="workflow" title="Reuse Workflows" href="/gh-aw/guides/campaigns/specs/#workflows">
    Coordinate existing agentic workflows without modification

## Example Campaign

A simple framework upgrade campaign:

```yaml
---
id: framework-upgrade
name: "Framework Upgrade"
project-url: "https://github.com/orgs/myorg/projects/42"
tracker-label: "campaign:framework-upgrade"

objective: "Upgrade all services to Framework vNext"
kpis:
  - id: services_upgraded
    name: "Services upgraded"
    priority: primary
    target: 50

workflows:
  - framework-upgrade-worker

governance:
  max-new-items-per-run: 10
---

Coordinate systematic upgrades across all services.
```

When compiled, this generates an orchestrator that discovers work, tracks progress on the GitHub Project board, and coordinates worker workflows to execute upgrades.

## Common Use Cases

    Coordinate changes across repositories with automated tracking
  </FeatureCard>
  <FeatureCard icon="shield-check" title="Security Fixes" badge="time-bound">
    Resolve vulnerabilities systematically with clear progress metrics
  </FeatureCard>
  <FeatureCard icon="beaker" title="Quality Improvements" badge="ongoing">
    Enhance test coverage and documentation incrementally
  </FeatureCard>
  <FeatureCard icon="tools" title="Large Refactorings" badge="phased">
    Execute architectural changes with milestone tracking
  </FeatureCard>

## How It Works

Campaigns have three components:

1. **Campaign Spec** (`.campaign.md`) - Define objectives, KPIs, and governance rules
2. **Orchestrator** (`.campaign.lock.yml`) - Auto-generated coordinator workflow
3. **Workers** - Your existing agentic workflows (no changes needed)

The orchestrator discovers work, updates your project board, and delegates to workers. Workers stay focused on their specific tasks while the orchestrator handles coordination.
