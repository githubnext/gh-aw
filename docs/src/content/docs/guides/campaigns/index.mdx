## What are agentic campaigns?

Agentic campaigns coordinate [AI agents](/gh-aw/reference/glossary/#agent) across multiple workflow runs to achieve specific goals. Instead of one-off automation, campaigns provide structured coordination: clear objectives, measurable progress (KPIs), and a unified dashboard (GitHub Project) that tracks work from start to completion.

**How it works:**
1. **Define** - Create a `.campaign.md` spec with your objective, KPIs, and worker workflows
2. **Compile** - Run `gh aw compile` to generate the orchestrator workflow
3. **Track** - GitHub Project automatically reflects progress as workflows execute
4. **Complete** - Campaign reaches its goal with full visibility and governance

### Campaigns vs Workflows

| Agentic Workflow | Agentic Campaign |
|------------------|------------------|
| Executes single task | Coordinates multiple tasks toward a goal |
| Event-triggered or scheduled | Strategic initiative over time |
| Standalone automation | Orchestrated with shared progress tracking |
| Success/failure per run | Success measured by KPIs across runs |

## Example: Framework Upgrade Campaign

Here's a simple campaign that coordinates dependency upgrades across services:

```yaml
---
id: framework-upgrade
name: "Framework Upgrade"
project-url: "https://github.com/orgs/myorg/projects/42"
tracker-label: "campaign:framework-upgrade"

objective: "Upgrade all services to Framework vNext with zero downtime."
kpis:
  - id: services_upgraded
    name: "Services upgraded"
    priority: primary
    direction: "increase"
    target: 50

workflows:
  - framework-upgrade-worker

governance:
  max-new-items-per-run: 10
  max-discovery-items-per-run: 100
---

Coordinate systematic upgrades across all services.
```

The `gh aw compile` command generates an orchestrator workflow that:
- Discovers work items using the tracker label
- Updates the GitHub Project board automatically
- Tracks metrics and progress toward the 50-service goal
- Coordinates worker workflows that do the actual upgrades

## Campaign Architecture

Campaigns consist of three key components:

1. **Campaign Spec** (`.campaign.md`) - The contract defining objectives, KPIs, governance, and wiring
2. **Orchestrator Workflow** (`.campaign.lock.yml`) - Generated workflow that coordinates the campaign
3. **Worker Workflows** - Your existing agentic workflows that do the actual work

The orchestrator discovers work items, updates the project board, and coordinates workers. Workers remain campaign-agnostic and focus on their specific tasks (opening PRs, running fixes, etc.).

> **Multi-Agent Coordination**  
> Campaigns enable meta-orchestration where specialized agents manage the agent ecosystem itself, coordinating multiple workflows toward shared goals.
