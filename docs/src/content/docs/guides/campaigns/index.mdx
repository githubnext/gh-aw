## What are Agentic Campaigns?

**[Agentic campaigns](/gh-aw/reference/glossary/#agentic-campaign)** bundle agentic workflows around a shared goal.

Campaigns provide tracking infrastructure to coordinate work across repositories and teams, with all work visible through GitHub Projects.

## Why use campaigns?

    Coordinate existing dispatchable workflows instead of rewriting automation.

    Track work and status updates in one GitHub Project board.
  </FeatureCard>
  <FeatureCard icon="shield" title="Built-in Governance" href="/gh-aw/guides/campaigns/specs/#governance-pacing--safety">
    Cap updates per run, opt out items, and keep changes predictable.

## Natural language to Campaign

Campaigns use agentic workflows to generate configuration from natural language descriptions.

**Example input**: Describe your goal in plain language:

```md
Burn down all open code security alerts, prioritizing file-write alerts first
and batching up to 3 related alerts/PR with a brief fix rationale comment.
```

The campaign generator converts this into a **[campaign spec](/gh-aw/guides/campaigns/specs/)** in a pull request for review. Essential spec components include:

```yaml
---
id: security-alert-burndown
name: "Security Alert Burndown"
description: "Drive the code security alerts backlog to zero"

# GitHub Project for tracking
project-url: "https://github.com/orgs/ORG/projects/1"
tracker-label: "campaign:security-alert-burndown"

# Strategic goals
objective: "Reduce open code security alerts to zero without breaking CI."
kpis:
  - id: open_alerts
    name: "Open alerts"
    priority: primary
    direction: "decrease"
    target: 0

# Worker workflows to dispatch
workflows:
  - security-alert-fix

# Governance and pacing
governance:
  max-project-updates-per-run: 10
  max-comments-per-run: 10
---
```

The spec is validated and compiled into the campaign orchestrator workflow (`.campaign.lock.yml`) that GitHub Actions executes.

Once merged, the orchestrator runs on schedule (daily by default) to [dispatch worker workflows, discover items, update the Project board, and report status](/gh-aw/guides/campaigns/lifecycle/).

- [Campaign specs](/gh-aw/guides/campaigns/specs/) – fields you can configure
- [Campaign Lifecycle](/gh-aw/guides/campaigns/lifecycle/) – what the orchestrator does each run
- [CLI commands](/gh-aw/guides/campaigns/cli-commands/) – inspect and validate campaigns
