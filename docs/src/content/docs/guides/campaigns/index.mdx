## What are GitHub Agentic Campaigns?

GitHub agentic campaigns coordinate one or more [agentic workflows](/gh-aw/introduction/overview/) toward a single goal.

**How it works:**
1. **Define** - Write a `.campaign.md` spec with objectives and workflows
2. **Compile** - Generate the orchestrator with `gh aw compile`
3. **Execute** - Orchestrator coordinates work (passive tracking or active execution)
4. **Track** - GitHub Project board shows real-time progress

## Why Use Campaigns?

## Example Campaign

A campaign is defined by a **Campaign Spec** `.campaign.md`.
Here is an example of such a file for a simple framework upgrade campaign:

```yaml
---
id: framework-upgrade
name: "Framework Upgrade"
project-url: "https://github.com/orgs/myorg/projects/42"
tracker-label: "campaign:framework-upgrade"

objective: "Upgrade all services to Framework vNext"
kpis:
  - id: services_upgraded
    name: "Services upgraded"
    priority: primary
    target: 50

workflows:
  - framework-scanner
  - framework-upgrader

# Enable active workflow execution
execute-workflows: true

governance:
  max-project-updates-per-run: 20
---
```
With `execute-workflows: true`, the orchestrator will:
- Run `framework-scanner` (create it if doesn't exist)
- Test newly created workflows before use
- Execute `framework-upgrader` using scanner outputs
- Track all progress on the GitHub Project board

When compiled, this generates an orchestrator that discovers work, tracks progress on the GitHub Project board, and coordinates worker workflows to execute upgrades.

Note that there are two orchestration modes:
**Passive coordination** (default): Discover and track work created by independent workflows.
**Active execution** (`execute-workflows: true`): Run workflows directly, create missing workflows, and drive progress.

Apart from this spec file, a campaign is composed of:
**Orchestrator** (`.campaign.lock.yml`) - Auto-generated coordinator workflow
**Workers** - Your existing agentic workflows (no changes needed)

The orchestrator discovers work, updates your project board, and delegates to workers. Workers stay focused on their specific tasks while the orchestrator handles coordination.
