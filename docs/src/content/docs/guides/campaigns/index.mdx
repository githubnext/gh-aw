## What are Agentic Campaigns?

**[Agentic campaigns](/gh-aw/reference/glossary/#agentic-campaign)** are initiatives that coordinate multiple [agentic workflows](/gh-aw/reference/glossary/#agentic-workflow) toward a shared goal.

When you need to roll out changes across many repositories—like upgrading dependencies, fixing security issues, or standardizing configurations—campaigns provide the orchestration layer you need to do that efficiently.

They run on a schedule to work through repositories systematically, dispatch workers in batches to control load and avoid rate limits, and track all progress centrally in [GitHub Projects](/gh-aw/reference/glossary/#github-projects-projects-v2).

You get complete visibility into what's done, what's in progress, and what's blocked—all in one place.

## When to use Campaigns

Choose a campaign when you need coordination across repos or multiple workflows, with progress tracked in one place.

- **Coordinate multiple worker workflows** that each do part of the job
- **Work across many repositories** (using campaign scope)
- **Track progress in one place** (a single [GitHub Project](/gh-aw/reference/glossary/#github-projects-projects-v2))
- **Roll out changes in batches across repos** (repeatable runs with per-run limits and central tracking)

**Don't need a campaign?** A single scheduled workflow is simpler if you're just automating work in one repository.

**Not sure?** Start with one repository and one worker workflow, then scale up once you see how it works.

## Campaign Specs

To create a campaign, you write a single markdown file:

- `.github/workflows/<id>.campaign.md`

That file has two parts:

- **[Frontmatter](/gh-aw/reference/glossary/#frontmatter)**: the configuration ([GitHub Project URL](/gh-aw/reference/glossary/#github-projects-projects-v2), scope, worker list, governance limits)
- **Markdown body**: the narrative (objective, KPIs, prioritization, constraints)

Here’s a small example:

```markdown wrap
---
id: dependency-upgrades
project-url: "https://github.com/orgs/ORG/projects/1"
scope:
  - "org:ORG"
workflows:
  - dependency-scanner
  - dependency-upgrader
---

# Dependency Upgrades

Upgrade dependencies across repos.
```

See: [Campaign specs](/gh-aw/guides/campaigns/specs/).

## From markdown to GitHub Actions

Just like regular workflows, campaigns get compiled:

- You run `gh aw compile`
- The compiler produces a **[workflow lock file](/gh-aw/reference/glossary/#workflow-lock-file-lockyml)** (`.lock.yml`) that GitHub Actions runs

This is the same idea as [compilation](/gh-aw/reference/glossary/#compilation) for normal workflows: you edit human-friendly markdown, GitHub Actions runs the compiled YAML.

## Orchestrator + workers (who does what)

Campaigns split responsibilities on purpose:

- **Orchestrator (generated from the spec)**
  - Runs on a schedule
  - Coordinates and decides what to do next
  - Uses **[safe outputs](/gh-aw/reference/glossary/#safe-outputs)** to dispatch worker workflows
- **Workers (you provide these)**
  - Are normal agentic workflows triggered via [`workflow_dispatch`](/gh-aw/reference/glossary/#workflow_dispatch)
  - Do the actual GitHub writes (issues/PRs/Projects/comments) using their own safe outputs

## What you’ll see in GitHub

When a campaign is working, you’ll usually see:

- A compiled workflow named `<id>.campaign.lock.yml` in `.github/workflows/`
- A GitHub Project filling up with issues/PRs created by workers
- Tracking labels on those issues/PRs like `z_campaign_<id>`
- Optional [labels](/gh-aw/reference/glossary/#labels) you can use to group and filter related workflows
- Worker workflow runs that create PRs and move items through statuses
