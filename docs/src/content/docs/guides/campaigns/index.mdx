## What are agentic campaigns?

**Coordinate AI agents across multiple workflow runs** with structured, goal-driven initiatives tracked in GitHub Projects. Strategic automation for large-scale repository operations.

Agentic campaigns coordinate AI agents to achieve strategic goals. Define objectives with measurable KPIs and track progress automatically through GitHub Projects.

**How it works:**
1. **Define** - Write a `.campaign.md` spec with objectives and workflows
2. **Compile** - Generate the orchestrator with `gh aw compile`
3. **Execute** - Orchestrator coordinates work (passive tracking or active execution)
4. **Track** - GitHub Project board shows real-time progress

### Campaign Modes

**Passive coordination** (default): Discover and track work created by independent workflows.

**Active execution** (`execute-workflows: true`): Run workflows directly, create missing workflows, and drive progress.

### Campaigns vs Workflows

| Agentic Workflow | Agentic Campaign |
|------------------|------------------|
| Executes single task | Coordinates multiple tasks toward a goal |
| Event-triggered or scheduled | Strategic initiative over time |
| Standalone automation | Orchestrated with progress tracking |
| Success/failure per run | Success measured by KPIs |

## Example Campaign

A simple framework upgrade campaign with active execution:

```yaml
---
id: framework-upgrade
name: "Framework Upgrade"
project-url: "https://github.com/orgs/myorg/projects/42"
tracker-label: "campaign:framework-upgrade"

objective: "Upgrade all services to Framework vNext"
kpis:
  - id: services_upgraded
    name: "Services upgraded"
    priority: primary
    target: 50

workflows:
  - framework-scanner
  - framework-upgrader

# Enable active workflow execution
execute-workflows: true

governance:
  max-project-updates-per-run: 20
---
```

With `execute-workflows: true`, the orchestrator will:
- Run `framework-scanner` (create it if doesn't exist)
- Test newly created workflows before use
- Execute `framework-upgrader` using scanner outputs
- Track all progress on the GitHub Project board

When compiled, this generates an orchestrator that discovers work, tracks progress on the GitHub Project board, and coordinates worker workflows to execute upgrades.

## How It Works

Campaigns have three components:

1. **Campaign Spec** (`.campaign.md`) - Define objectives, KPIs, and governance rules
2. **Orchestrator** (`.campaign.lock.yml`) - Auto-generated coordinator workflow
3. **Workers** - Your existing agentic workflows (no changes needed)

The orchestrator discovers work, updates your project board, and delegates to workers. Workers stay focused on their specific tasks while the orchestrator handles coordination.
