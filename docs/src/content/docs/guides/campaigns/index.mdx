## Overview

Agentic campaigns coordinate one or more [agentic workflows](/gh-aw/introduction/overview/) toward a single goal. A campaign provides structure for managing initiatives—defining objectives with measurable KPIs, tracking progress on GitHub Projects, and optionally executing workflows to drive work forward.

## Why use campaigns?

## Quick Start

1. **Create** an issue describing your campaign goal
2. **Apply** the `create-agentic-campaign` label to the issue
3. **Wait** 2-3 minutes for automated campaign generation and compilation
4. **Review** the pull request with your complete campaign setup
5. **Merge** and run the orchestrator workflow from the Actions tab

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Use the automated campaign creation flow—it's the only supported way to create campaigns. It handles project board creation, workflow discovery, spec generation, and compilation automatically.

## Campaign modes

Campaigns operate in two distinct modes:

### ProjectOps Pattern (default)
**What it is:** A [ProjectOps](/gh-aw/examples/issue-pr-events/projectops/) pattern where the orchestrator discovers and tracks work created by independent workflows

The orchestrator discovers and tracks work created by independent workflows. This is ProjectOps—automated project board management—with added campaign structure (objectives, KPIs, governance, metrics persistence).

**How it works:**
- Worker workflows run on their own schedules
- Workers create issues/PRs with tracker labels
- Orchestrator discovers items and updates project board
- Progress tracked against campaign objectives
- No workflow execution by the orchestrator

**When to use:** When workflows should remain independently scheduled but you want campaign-level tracking and reporting.

### Campaign Orchestration (`execute-workflows: true`)
**What it is:** True campaign mode where the orchestrator actively runs workflows and drives progress

The orchestrator actively runs workflows, creates missing ones, and drives progress toward objectives. This is true campaign orchestration where the campaign manages and executes work autonomously.

**How it works:**
- Orchestrator executes workflows sequentially
- Creates missing workflows based on campaign needs
- Tests new workflows before use
- Collects outputs for coordination
- Drives progress actively toward objectives

**When to use:** When the campaign should autonomously manage and execute workflows to drive complex initiatives.

**Progression path:** Start with ProjectOps pattern → Enable campaign orchestration when ready.

Apart from the spec file, a campaign includes:
- **Orchestrator** (`.campaign.lock.yml`) - Auto-generated coordinator workflow
- **Workers** - Your existing agentic workflows (or created automatically in orchestration mode)
- **Project Board** - GitHub Projects dashboard for tracking

The orchestrator updates your project board and (in orchestration mode) delegates work execution to workers. Workers stay focused on their specific tasks while the orchestrator handles coordination.

## Example campaign

A campaign is defined by a **Campaign Spec** `.campaign.md` file.
Here is an example for a framework upgrade campaign:

```yaml
---
id: framework-upgrade
name: "Framework Upgrade"
project-url: "https://github.com/orgs/myorg/projects/42"
tracker-label: "campaign:framework-upgrade"

objective: "Upgrade all services to Framework vNext"
kpis:
  - id: services_upgraded
    name: "Services upgraded"
    priority: primary
    target: 50

workflows:
  - framework-scanner
  - framework-upgrader

# Enable active workflow execution
execute-workflows: true

governance:
  max-project-updates-per-run: 20
---
```

With `execute-workflows: true`, the orchestrator will:
- Run `framework-scanner` (creates it if it doesn't exist)
- Test newly created agentic workflows before use
- Execute `framework-upgrader` using scanner outputs
- Track all progress on the GitHub Project board

> [!NOTE]
> Without `execute-workflows: true`, this would be a **ProjectOps pattern** where workflows run independently and the orchestrator only tracks their outputs on the project board.
