Agentic campaigns coordinate [agentic workflows](/gh-aw/introduction/overview/) to achieve specific goals with automated tracking and progress measurement. They provide structure for multi-workflow initiatives—from security remediation to framework migrations—with measurable KPIs and built-in governance.

## What is a campaign?

A campaign is a **goal-driven initiative** that uses AI agents to coordinate work across your repositories. Think of it as a project manager that:

- **Defines clear objectives** with measurable success criteria
- **Coordinates multiple workflows** that work toward the same goal
- **Tracks progress automatically** on GitHub Project boards
- **Enforces governance policies** to keep automation safe and predictable

Unlike single workflows that perform one task, campaigns orchestrate multiple workflows over time to drive complex initiatives to completion.

## Why use campaigns?

Campaigns solve coordination challenges that single workflows can't handle alone:

## How campaigns work

A campaign consists of three key components:

1. **Campaign Spec** (`.campaign.md` file)
   - Defines objectives, KPIs, and success criteria
   - Lists workflows to coordinate
   - Configures governance policies and limits

2. **Orchestrator Workflow** (auto-generated `.campaign.lock.yml`)
   - Discovers work items created by workflows
   - Updates GitHub Project board automatically
   - Reports progress and metrics
   - Optionally executes workflows on your behalf

3. **GitHub Project Board**
   - Visual dashboard showing campaign progress
   - Custom fields for tracking workflow ownership, priority, and status
   - Roadmap views for timeline visualization

**Worker workflows** continue running as normal—creating issues, opening PRs, and doing their specific tasks. The orchestrator simply discovers their outputs and tracks everything in one place.

## When to use campaigns

Use campaigns when you need to coordinate multiple workflows or track progress toward a specific goal:

**✅ Good use cases:**
- **Migration projects**: "Upgrade all services to Node.js 20" with scanner and upgrader workflows
- **Security initiatives**: "Resolve all high-severity vulnerabilities" with detection and remediation workflows
- **Quality improvements**: "Increase test coverage to 90%" with analyzer and test generator workflows
- **Large refactorings**: "Modernize authentication" with audit, migration, and validation workflows

**❌ Not suitable for:**
- Single-workflow automation (just use regular agentic workflows)
- One-time tasks without ongoing coordination needs
- Simple scheduled tasks without progress tracking
- Workflows that don't create trackable work items

> [!TIP]
> Start with a simple campaign tracking 2-3 existing workflows. You can add complexity later as you learn the patterns.

## Quick start

Create your first campaign in minutes using the automated creation flow:

1. **Create an issue** describing your campaign goal
2. **Apply the `create-agentic-campaign` label** to trigger automated setup
3. **Wait 2-3 minutes** for campaign generation and compilation
4. **Review the pull request** with your complete campaign
5. **Merge and run** the orchestrator workflow from the Actions tab

The automated flow handles project board creation, workflow discovery, spec generation, and compilation—everything you need to start coordinating workflows.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Use the automated campaign creation flow—it's the only supported way to create campaigns. Manual creation is complex and error-prone.

## Campaign modes

Campaigns operate in two distinct modes:

### ProjectOps Pattern (default)
**What it is:** A [ProjectOps](/gh-aw/examples/issue-pr-events/projectops/) pattern where the orchestrator discovers and tracks work created by independent workflows

The orchestrator discovers and tracks work created by independent workflows. This is ProjectOps—automated project board management—with added campaign structure (objectives, KPIs, governance, metrics persistence).

**How it works:**
- Worker workflows run on their own schedules
- Workers create issues/PRs with tracker labels
- Orchestrator discovers items and updates project board
- Progress tracked against campaign objectives
- No workflow execution by the orchestrator

**When to use:** When workflows should remain independently scheduled but you want campaign-level tracking and reporting.

### Campaign Orchestration (`execute-workflows: true`)
**What it is:** True campaign mode where the orchestrator actively runs workflows and drives progress

The orchestrator actively runs workflows, creates missing ones, and drives progress toward objectives. This is true campaign orchestration where the campaign manages and executes work autonomously.

**How it works:**
- Orchestrator executes workflows sequentially
- Creates missing workflows based on campaign needs
- Tests new workflows before use
- Collects outputs for coordination
- Drives progress actively toward objectives

**When to use:** When the campaign should autonomously manage and execute workflows to drive complex initiatives.

**Progression path:** Start with ProjectOps pattern → Enable campaign orchestration when ready.

Apart from the spec file, a campaign includes:
- **Orchestrator** (`.campaign.lock.yml`) - Auto-generated coordinator workflow
- **Workers** - Your existing agentic workflows (or created automatically in orchestration mode)
- **Project Board** - GitHub Projects dashboard for tracking

The orchestrator updates your project board and (in orchestration mode) delegates work execution to workers. Workers stay focused on their specific tasks while the orchestrator handles coordination.

## Example campaign

A campaign is defined by a **Campaign Spec** `.campaign.md` file.
Here is an example for a framework upgrade campaign:

```yaml
---
id: framework-upgrade
name: "Framework Upgrade"
project-url: "https://github.com/orgs/myorg/projects/42"
tracker-label: "campaign:framework-upgrade"

objective: "Upgrade all services to Framework vNext"
kpis:
  - id: services_upgraded
    name: "Services upgraded"
    priority: primary
    target: 50

workflows:
  - framework-scanner
  - framework-upgrader

# Enable active workflow execution
execute-workflows: true

governance:
  max-project-updates-per-run: 20
---
```

With `execute-workflows: true`, the orchestrator will:
- Run `framework-scanner` (creates it if it doesn't exist)
- Test newly created agentic workflows before use
- Execute `framework-upgrader` using scanner outputs
- Track all progress on the GitHub Project board

> [!NOTE]
> Without `execute-workflows: true`, this would be a **ProjectOps pattern** where workflows run independently and the orchestrator only tracks their outputs on the project board.
