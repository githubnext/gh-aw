## What are Agentic Campaigns?

[**Agentic campaigns**](/gh-aw/reference/glossary/#agentic-campaign) help you coordinate **[agentic workflows](/gh-aw/reference/glossary/#agentic-workflow)** toward a shared goal.

Imagine you have a goal that takes more than one workflow run, across one or more repositories. You can write a worker workflow to do the work, but you still need a way to schedule it, fan it out, track what it created, and report progress.

Campaigns provide that orchestration layer: you define the goal and guardrails in a campaign spec, which gets compiled into an orchestrator workflow that runs on a schedule. On each run, the orchestrator can dispatch worker workflows, track the issues and pull requests they create, update a GitHub Project board, and publish a status update with metrics.

Use campaigns when work needs coordination across multiple workflows or repositories, plus tracking, pacing, and governance. If a single workflow is enough (even on a schedule), start with a standalone agentic workflow.

## Why use campaigns?

    Cap updates per run, opt out items, and keep changes predictable.

## Natural language to campaign

Campaigns use agentic workflows to generate configuration from natural language descriptions.

**Example input**: Describe your goal in plain language:

```md
Burn down all open code security alerts, prioritizing file-write alerts first
and batching up to 3 related alerts/PR with a brief fix rationale comment.
```

The campaign generator converts this into a **[campaign spec](/gh-aw/guides/campaigns/specs/)** in a pull request for review. Essential spec components include:

```yaml
---
id: security-alert-burndown
name: "Security Alert Burndown"
description: "Drive the code security alerts backlog to zero"

# GitHub Project for tracking
project-url: "https://github.com/orgs/ORG/projects/1"
tracker-label: "campaign:security-alert-burndown"

# Strategic goals
objective: "Reduce open code security alerts to zero without breaking CI."
kpis:
  - id: open_alerts
    name: "Open alerts"
    priority: primary
    direction: "decrease"
    target: 0

# Worker workflows to dispatch
workflows:
  - security-alert-fix

# Governance and pacing
governance:
  max-project-updates-per-run: 10
  max-comments-per-run: 10
---
```

The spec is validated and compiled into the campaign orchestrator workflow (`.campaign.lock.yml`) that GitHub Actions executes.

Once merged, the orchestrator runs on schedule (daily by default) to [dispatch worker workflows, discover items, update the Project board, and report status](/gh-aw/guides/campaigns/lifecycle/).
