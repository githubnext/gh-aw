## Overview

Agentic campaigns coordinate one or more [agentic workflows](/gh-aw/introduction/overview/) toward a single goal.

## Why use campaigns?

## Workflow

1. **Define** - Write a `.campaign.md` spec with objectives and workflows
2. **Compile** - Generate the orchestrator with `gh aw compile`
3. **Execute** - Orchestrator coordinates work (passive tracking or active execution)
4. **Track** - GitHub Project board shows real-time progress

When compiled, this generates an orchestrator that discovers work, tracks progress on the GitHub Project board, and optionally executes workflows to drive progress.

## Campaign modes

Campaigns operate in two distinct modes that serve different coordination needs:

### Passive Coordination (default)
**Conceptually:** Enhanced [ProjectOps](/gh-aw/examples/issue-pr-events/projectops/) with campaign structure

The orchestrator discovers and tracks work created by independent workflows. This is fundamentally ProjectOps—automated project board management—enhanced with campaign-specific features like KPI tracking, governance policies, and metrics persistence.

**How it works:**
- Worker workflows run on their own schedules
- Workers create issues/PRs with tracker labels
- Orchestrator discovers items and updates project board
- Progress tracked against campaign objectives
- No workflow execution by the campaign

**When to use:** When workflows should remain independently scheduled but you want campaign-level tracking and reporting.

### Active Execution (`execute-workflows: true`)
**Conceptually:** True campaign orchestration with autonomous workflow management

The orchestrator actively runs workflows, creates missing ones, and drives progress toward objectives. This distinguishes full "campaigns" from ProjectOps-based tracking by making the campaign self-sufficient and actively managed.

**How it works:**
- Orchestrator executes workflows sequentially
- Creates missing workflows based on campaign needs
- Tests new workflows before use
- Collects outputs for coordination
- Drives progress actively toward objectives

**When to use:** When the campaign should autonomously manage and execute workflows to drive complex initiatives.

**Progression path:** Start with ProjectOps → Add passive campaign tracking → Enable active execution when ready.

Apart from the spec file, a campaign includes:
- **Orchestrator** (`.campaign.lock.yml`) - Auto-generated coordinator workflow
- **Workers** - Your existing agentic workflows (or created automatically in active mode)
- **Project Board** - GitHub Projects dashboard for tracking

The orchestrator updates your project board and (in active mode) delegates work execution to workers. Workers stay focused on their specific tasks while the orchestrator handles coordination.

## Example campaign

A campaign is defined by a **Campaign Spec** `.campaign.md`.
Here is an example of such a file for a simple framework upgrade campaign:

```yaml
---
id: framework-upgrade
name: "Framework Upgrade"
project-url: "https://github.com/orgs/myorg/projects/42"
tracker-label: "campaign:framework-upgrade"

objective: "Upgrade all services to Framework vNext"
kpis:
  - id: services_upgraded
    name: "Services upgraded"
    priority: primary
    target: 50

workflows:
  - framework-scanner
  - framework-upgrader

# Enable active workflow execution
execute-workflows: true

governance:
  max-project-updates-per-run: 20
---
```
With `execute-workflows: true`, the orchestrator will:
- Run `framework-scanner` (create it if doesn't exist)
- Test newly created agentic workflows before use
- Execute `framework-upgrader` using scanner outputs
- Track all progress on the GitHub Project board

**Note:** Without `execute-workflows: true`, this would be a **passive campaign** (enhanced ProjectOps) where workflows run independently and the orchestrator only tracks their outputs on the project board.
