## What is a campaign?

Campaigns are a lightweight wrapper around your existing [agentic workflows](/gh-aw/introduction/overview/): you define a goal, and a generated orchestrator keeps a GitHub Project up to date over time.

You get:

- A **campaign spec** (reviewable config)
- An **orchestrator workflow** (runs on a schedule)
- A **Project board** (dashboard + status updates)

## Why use campaigns

<FeatureGrid columns={2}>
  <FeatureCard icon="goal" title="Strategic Goals" href="/gh-aw/guides/campaigns/specs/#core-fields-what-they-do">
    Define outcomes and track progress over time
  </FeatureCard>
  <FeatureCard icon="project" title="Unified Tracking" href="/gh-aw/reference/safe-outputs/#project-board-updates-update-project">
    One Project board for visibility and coordination
  </FeatureCard>
  <FeatureCard icon="shield" title="Built-in Governance" href="/gh-aw/guides/campaigns/specs/#governance-pacing--safety">
    Pacing controls keep updates predictable
  </FeatureCard>
  <FeatureCard icon="workflow" title="Reuse Workflows" href="/gh-aw/guides/campaigns/specs/#workflows">
    Reuse workflows you already have
  </FeatureCard>
</FeatureGrid>

## Quick start

1. Create an issue describing the goal
2. Apply the `create-agentic-campaign` label
3. Review the generated pull request
4. Merge and run the orchestrator from the Actions tab

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Use the automated campaign creation flow—it's the only supported way to create campaigns.

## What happens when it runs

On each orchestrator run:

1. (Optional) **Dispatches worker workflows** via `workflow_dispatch`.
2. **Discovers work items** and syncs them into the Project.
3. **Updates fields** (status, dates, etc.) within configured limits.
4. **Posts a Project status update** (summary + next steps).

> [!NOTE]
> Dispatch is fire-and-forget: the orchestrator does not wait for workflows to finish.

## When campaigns are a good fit

- A time-bound initiative (migration, security push, cleanup sprint)
- You want a single place to track progress (Project + status updates)
- You already have (or can author) dispatchable worker workflows

If you want ProjectOps-style tracking without dispatching workflows, use the [ProjectOps example](/gh-aw/examples/issue-pr-events/projectops/) directly.

## Example (spec)

A campaign is defined by a `.campaign.md` spec file:

```yaml
---
id: framework-upgrade
name: "Framework Upgrade"
project-url: "https://github.com/orgs/myorg/projects/42"
tracker-label: "campaign:framework-upgrade"

objective: "Upgrade all services to Framework vNext"
kpis:
  - id: services_upgraded
    name: "Services upgraded"
    priority: primary
    target: 50

workflows:
  - framework-scanner
  - framework-upgrader

# Enable active workflow execution


governance:
  max-project-updates-per-run: 20

```

## Next steps

- [Getting started](/gh-aw/guides/campaigns/getting-started/) – create your first campaign
- [Flow & lifecycle](/gh-aw/guides/campaigns/flow/) – what the orchestrator does each run
- [Campaign specs](/gh-aw/guides/campaigns/specs/) – fields you can configure
- [CLI commands](/gh-aw/guides/campaigns/cli-commands/) – inspect and validate campaigns
