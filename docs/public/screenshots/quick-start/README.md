### PAT (Personal Access Token) Creation Flow

1. **pat-token-creation-page.svg** - Shows the GitHub PAT creation page with basic settings filled in (token name, expiration, description, resource owner, repository access)

2. **pat-copilot-requests-permission.svg** - Shows the Account permissions section with "Copilot Requests" permission highlighted and set to "Read and write"

3. **pat-generate-token.svg** - Shows the "Generate token" button at the bottom of the page

## Note on Placeholders

These are currently **placeholder SVG images** that show the structure and key elements that should be in each screenshot. They should be replaced with actual screenshots from GitHub's UI showing:

- The actual GitHub interface styling
- Real form fields and buttons
- Accurate positioning of UI elements
- Any recent UI changes from GitHub

## How to Replace with Real Screenshots

1. Navigate to https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens/new
2. Take screenshots at each key step:
   - After filling in basic token settings
   - When scrolling to Account permissions and selecting Copilot Requests
   - Before clicking Generate token
3. Save as PNG or JPEG files with the same filenames (replacing .svg extension)
4. Update the image references in the documentation if needed

## Screenshot Guidelines

- Use high-resolution screenshots (at least 1200px wide)
- Highlight important UI elements (arrows, boxes, annotations)
- Keep sensitive information (usernames, etc.) generic or blurred
- Ensure screenshots show the most current GitHub UI
