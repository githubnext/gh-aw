# üöÄ Tutorial ‚Äî Get a workflow running in minutes

This short, hands-on tutorial will get you from zero to a running agentic workflow. You'll install the extension, add a sample workflow, set up the required secrets, compile the workflow to a lock file, and run it. Ready? Let's go! üéâ

What you'll do

- Install the `gh-aw` extension
- Add the sample `weekly-research` workflow to your repository
- Add the required AI API key secret
- Compile and run the workflow
- Inspect logs and iterate

Prerequisites

- GitHub CLI (`gh`) installed and authenticated. Check with:

```bash
gh auth status
gh --version
```

- A repository you can push to (or a fork) and permission to add Actions secrets.

Step 1 ‚Äî Install the extension

```bash
gh extension install githubnext/gh-aw
```

Verify that `gh aw` is available:

```bash
gh aw --help
gh aw version
```

Step 2 ‚Äî Add a sample workflow

The easiest way to get started is to add a sample from the Agentics collection. From your repository root run:

```bash
gh aw add weekly-research -r githubnext/agentics --pr
```

This creates a pull request that adds `.github/workflows/weekly-research.md` and the compiled `.lock.yml`. Review and merge the PR into your repo.

Step 3 ‚Äî Add an AI secret

Agentic workflows use an AI engine. For Claude add this repository secret:

```bash
gh secret set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY -a actions --body "<your-anthropic-api-key>"
```

For Codex (experimental), add:

```bash
gh secret set OPENAI_API_KEY -a actions --body "<your-openai-api-key>"
```

These secrets are used by Actions at runtime.

Step 4 ‚Äî Compile and preview

Generate the compiled workflow file (`.lock.yml`) from your markdown source:

```bash
gh aw compile
```

To watch for edits while authoring (useful during development):

```bash
gh aw compile --watch
```

Tip: run `gh aw compile --instructions` to generate a Copilot instructions file that improves authoring suggestions in VS Code.

Step 5 ‚Äî Run the workflow

Trigger the workflow immediately (local execution or dispatch, depending on your setup):

```bash
gh aw run weekly-research
```

Download and inspect execution logs:

```bash
gh aw logs weekly-research
```

Quick workflow template (what a minimal workflow looks like)

```markdown
---
on:
  workflow_dispatch:

permissions:
  issues: write

tools:
  github:
    allowed: [add_issue_comment]

engine: claude
timeout_minutes: 5
---

# Say Hello

When triggered, read context and post a friendly comment.

1. Summarize the event in 1-2 sentences.
2. Post a helpful comment using the GitHub tool.
```

Authoring tips (fast)

- Keep sensitive keys and tokens in repository Actions secrets ‚Äî never hard-code them in markdown content.
- Use `gh aw compile --watch` when editing to get immediate feedback.
- Let Copilot help: `gh aw compile --instructions` writes a Copilot instructions file that improves suggestions while editing in VS Code.
- Follow the allowed expressions and security patterns in [Workflow Structure](workflow-structure.md) and [Frontmatter Options](frontmatter.md).

Troubleshooting & diagnostics

- `gh aw status` ‚Äî Check workflow installation status
- `gh aw logs` ‚Äî Download recent run logs and cost/usage analysis
- `gh aw inspect` ‚Äî Inspect MCP servers and tools
- If compilation fails, run `gh aw compile --verbose` for more details and follow the error output.

What's next?

- Tweak the frontmatter and content to fit your use case üë©‚Äçüíª
- Explore other samples in the Agentics repo
- Read more: [Workflow Structure](workflow-structure.md), [Frontmatter Options](frontmatter.md), [MCPs](mcps.md), and [Authoring in VS Code](vscode.md)

You did it ‚Äî you're ready to start automating with agentic workflows! ‚ú®
