Meet the Workflows (1): Issue Triage 🍬✨

Welcome back to the tour of Peli’s Agent Factory. Day 2 is our first stop on the factory floor: Issue Triage.

It’s one of the most immediately useful agentic workflows we run: when a new issue lands, the agent analyzes the report, replies with helpful context, and applies labels consistently — so maintainers can spend more time building and less time sorting.
