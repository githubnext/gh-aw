Welcome to our blog series, about our new technology for automated agentics on GitHub - GitHub Agentic Workflows!

Automated agentics are powerful, but what are they useful for in software repositories?

In this series we'd like to take you on a tour of ✨🍫 Peli’s Agent Factory 🍫✨ — where 100+ agentic workflows keep real repos humming. Take the tour: https://githubnext.github.io/gh-aw/blog/2026-01-12-welcome-to-pelis-agent-factory/ 

Automation isn't just about scripts—it's about creating intelligent agents that keep projects moving and achieve continuous improvement.
