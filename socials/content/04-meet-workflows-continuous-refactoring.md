Day 4 in Peli’s Agent Factory 🍫✨: Continuous Refactoring!

Two agents that keep codebases structurally tidy 🧠🔧
- Semantic Function Refactor (whole-repo organization)
- Go Pattern Detector (fast AST scan + deep agent review)

These agents look past “does it work?” and ask “does it live in the right place?” One does whole-repo semantic grouping (with Serena) to spot misplaced/outlier functions; the other uses ast-grep to cheaply detect patterns, then escalates to an agent only when needed.

Day 4 in Peli’s Agent Factory: Continuous Refactoring 🍫✨

After continuous simplification, the next stop on our tour is structural refactoring: agents that scan the whole codebase and flag opportunities to improve organization and consistency.

Two workflows:
- Semantic Function Refactor 🧠 
- Go Pattern Detector 🔍
