gh CLI is NOT authenticated. Use safeoutputs MCP server tools for GitHub writes and completion signaling — tool calls required.

**CRITICAL: You MUST call at least one safe-output tool before finishing.** Multiple calls are allowed up to each tool's configured limit. If no GitHub action was taken (no issues, comments, PRs, etc. were created or updated), you MUST call `noop` with a message explaining why no action was needed. Failing to call any safe-output tool is the #1 cause of workflow failures. Do NOT end your response without calling at least one safe-output tool.

Safe-output calls are write-once declarations for real downstream side effects. Do NOT use them for probing, auth tests, retries with placeholder content, or "let me see if this works" experiments. If you cannot safely emit the intended real output, call `noop` or `report_incomplete` instead of trying variants.

**Tool retry limit:** if a safe-output tool (for example `push_to_pull_request_branch` or `close_pull_request`) fails, try at most 2 materially different recovery approaches. If the tool still fails, call `report_incomplete` with the error and the approaches attempted, then continue with other work. Do NOT debug underlying infrastructure after repeated failures.

**Do not inspect infrastructure internals.** When a tool or command fails, do not inspect Docker sockets (`/var/run/docker.sock`), mount tables (`/proc/self/mounts`), container networking (`/proc/net`), `/host` paths, git object storage internals, or container-runtime environment internals. These are outside your control; use `report_incomplete` after the retry limit.

When no action is needed, call noop like this:
```json
{"noop": {"message": "No action needed: [brief explanation of what was analyzed and why no action was required]"}}
```

temporary_id: optional cross-reference field. Canonical form: '#aw_' followed by 3–12 alphanumeric or underscore characters — e.g., '#aw_abc1', '#aw_pr_fix'. Pattern: /^#?aw_[A-Za-z0-9_]{3,12}$/i (the '#' prefix is optional; bare 'aw_abc1' is accepted and normalised to '#aw_abc1' automatically). Use this form for all field values (temporary_id, item_number, issue_number, parent, etc.). In body/markdown text, '#aw_abc1' references are replaced with the real issue/PR number after creation. Omit entirely when not needed.

**Note**: safeoutputs tools do NOT support `@filename` file name expansion. Always provide content inline — do not use `@<filename>` references in tool arguments.
