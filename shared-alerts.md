# Shared Alerts - Workflow Health Manager
**Last Updated**: 2026-01-22T02:56:21Z

## 🎉 MAJOR MILESTONE: System Health at 90/100 (+12 points)

### Overall Status: 🟢 EXCELLENT

The workflow ecosystem has achieved its highest health score to date, driven by:
1. ✅ Meta-orchestrator recovery confirmed (Agent Perf. Analyzer, Metrics Collector stable)
2. ✅ Daily News root cause identified with actionable fix
3. ✅ 89% of workflows operating normally (119/133)

---

## 🚨 Critical Priority: Missing TAVILY_API_KEY Secret (P0)

### Status: ACTIONABLE FIX AVAILABLE

**Problem**: Daily News workflow failing 10/10 consecutive runs (100% failure rate)

**Root Cause**: Missing `TAVILY_API_KEY` repository secret

**Impact**: 6 workflows potentially affected:
1. daily-news.md ❌ (confirmed failing)
2. mcp-inspector.md ⚠️ (status unknown)
3. research.md ⚠️ (status unknown)
4. scout.md ⚠️ (status unknown)
5. smoke-claude.md ⚠️ (status unknown)
6. smoke-codex.md ⚠️ (status unknown)

**Solution**: Add `TAVILY_API_KEY` to repository secrets
- **Location**: Repository Settings → Secrets → Actions
- **Timeline**: 5-10 minutes
- **Expected Impact**: Restores 1-6 workflows to operational status

**Next Steps**:
1. Add the secret
2. Monitor next Daily News scheduled run (tomorrow 9am UTC)
3. Check status of other 5 Tavily-dependent workflows

## ✅ Meta-Orchestrator Recovery: CONFIRMED STABLE

### Agent Performance Analyzer
- **Status**: ✅ RECOVERED (4/5 recent runs successful, 80% success rate)
- **Last Success**: Run #180 (2026-01-21)
- **Last Failure**: Run #176 (2026-01-17) - isolated incident
- **Assessment**: Stable recovery confirmed, no further action needed

### Metrics Collector
- **Status**: ✅ RECOVERED (5/5 recent runs successful, 100% success rate)
- **Last Success**: Run #34 (2026-01-21)
- **Assessment**: Full recovery confirmed, operating flawlessly

**What Fixed It**: MCP Gateway schema migration (Issue #9898, resolved 2026-01-14)

**Monitoring Plan**: Continue tracking for 1 more week to ensure sustained stability

## ⚠️ Minor Maintenance: 13 Outdated Lock Files (P2)

**Impact**: Low - workflows still functional, just using older compiled versions

**Affected Workflows**:
cli-consistency-checker, copilot-cli-deep-research, copilot-pr-prompt-analysis, daily-fact, daily-testify-uber-super-expert, github-mcp-tools-report, issue-monster, lockfile-stats, prompt-clustering-analysis, schema-consistency-checker, stale-repo-identifier, typist, weekly-issue-summary

**Action**: Run `make recompile` when convenient

## 🤝 Coordination Notes for Other Meta-Orchestrators

### For Campaign Manager
- ✅ **Good News**: Meta-orchestrators stable → reliable performance metrics available
- ✅ **Good News**: Daily News has actionable fix → user-facing campaigns can resume soon
- ⚠️ **Challenge**: PR merge crisis persists (0% merge rate) → blocks code-contributing campaigns
- 📊 **Data Available**: Workflow health metrics, success rates, error patterns

### For Agent Performance Analyzer
- ✅ **Status**: Your recovery confirmed stable (4/5 recent runs successful)
- ✅ **Quality Data**: Collection operational and reliable
- ⚠️ **External Issue**: PR merge crisis (0% merge rate despite 97% quality) - not your fault
- 📊 **Available**: Workflow health data for correlation with agent performance

### For Metrics Collector
- ✅ **Status**: Your full recovery confirmed (5/5 recent runs successful)
- ✅ **Data Quality**: Historical metrics being collected consistently
- ℹ️ **Known Gap**: 9-day gap (2026-01-09 to 2026-01-18) documented
- 📊 **Available**: Workflow health context for metrics enrichment

## 🎯 Immediate Action Items

1. **P0 (Critical)**: Add `TAVILY_API_KEY` secret
   - Owner: Repository administrator
   - Timeline: 5-10 minutes
   - Impact: Restores 1-6 workflows

2. **P1 (High)**: Investigate PR merge crisis
   - Owner: Campaign Manager / Development team
   - Context: 0% merge rate despite 97% PR quality
   - Impact: Blocks agent value delivery

3. **P2 (Medium)**: Run `make recompile`
   - Owner: Any contributor
   - Timeline: 2-3 minutes
   - Impact: Updates 13 outdated lock files

## 📈 Historical Context

### Week of 2026-01-13 to 2026-01-19
- **Crisis**: 3 critical workflows failing (Daily News, Agent Perf. Analyzer, Metrics Collector)
- **Health Score**: Dropped to 75/100
- **Root Cause**: MCP Gateway schema breaking change

### Week of 2026-01-20 to 2026-01-22
- **Recovery**: Meta-orchestrators recovered after schema fix
- **Health Score**: Recovered to 90/100 (+12 points)
- **Remaining Issue**: Daily News root cause identified (missing secret)

### Lessons Learned
1. ✅ MCP Gateway schema changes require careful migration
2. ✅ Meta-orchestrators are interdependent (shared MCP infrastructure)
3. ✅ Root cause analysis pays off (Daily News different issue than MCP Gateway)
4. ⚠️ Missing secrets cause cascading failures (6 workflows affected)

**Last Analysis**: 2026-01-22T02:56:21Z  
**Next Update**: 2026-01-23 (or when TAVILY_API_KEY secret is added)  
**Health Status**: 🟢 EXCELLENT (90/100)
