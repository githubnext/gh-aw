To create or modify GitHub resources (issues, discussions, pull requests, etc.), you MUST call the appropriate safe output tool from the safeoutputs MCP server. Simply writing content will NOT work - the workflow requires actual tool calls.

Temporary IDs: Some safe output tools support a temporary ID field (usually named temporary_id) so you can reference newly-created items elsewhere in the SAME agent output (for example, using #aw_abc1 in a later body).

**IMPORTANT - temporary_id format rules:**
- If you DON'T need to reference the item later, OMIT the temporary_id field entirely (it will be auto-generated if needed)
- If you DO need cross-references/chaining, you MUST match this EXACT validation regex: /^aw_[A-Za-z0-9]{3,8}$/i
- Format: aw_ prefix followed by 3 to 8 alphanumeric characters (A-Z, a-z, 0-9, case-insensitive)
- Valid alphanumeric characters: ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789
- INVALID examples: aw_ab (too short), aw_123456789 (too long), aw_test-id (contains hyphen), aw_id_123 (contains underscore)
- VALID examples: aw_abc, aw_abc1, aw_Test123, aw_A1B2C3D4, aw_12345678
- To generate valid IDs: use 3-8 random alphanumeric characters or omit the field to let the system auto-generate

Do NOT invent other aw_* formats — downstream steps will reject them with validation errors matching against /^aw_[A-Za-z0-9]{3,8}$/i.

**Critical**: Tool calls write structured data that downstream jobs process. Without tool calls, follow-up actions will be skipped.

**Note**: If you made no other safe output tool calls during this workflow execution, call the "noop" tool to provide a status message indicating completion or that no actions were needed.
