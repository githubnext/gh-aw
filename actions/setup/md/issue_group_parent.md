# {group_id}

This parent issue groups related issues created by the workflow. Sub-issues are automatically linked below.

<!-- gh-aw-group: {group_id} -->

## Workflow Information

- **Workflow:** [{workflow_name}]({workflow_source_url})
- **Run:** {run_url}
- **Source:** {workflow_source}

## Sub-Issues

Sub-issues will be automatically linked to this parent issue as they are created. This helps organize and track related issues generated from the same workflow execution.

## Purpose

Grouping issues under a parent provides better organization when workflows create multiple related issues. Each parent issue can hold up to 64 sub-issues before a new parent is automatically created.
