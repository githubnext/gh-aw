**⚠️ Excessive Tool Denials**: The Copilot SDK hit the max tool denial guardrail and stopped the session early (`{denial_count}/{threshold}`).

**Last denied request:**
{reason}

This is a structured guardrail event (`guard.tool_denials_exceeded`) captured in `events.jsonl`.

<summary>How to fix this</summary>

The prompt attempted actions outside the workflow's allowed tools.

Update the workflow prompt and/or permissions so required actions are permitted:

```
The workflow {workflow_id} stopped because the Copilot SDK exceeded its tool denial threshold ({denial_count}/{threshold}).
Last denied request: {reason}

Please update the workflow so the prompt only uses tools permitted by the workflow tool policy.
```
