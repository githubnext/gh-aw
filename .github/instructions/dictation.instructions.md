# Fix text-to-speech errors in dictated text

## Technical Context

GitHub Agentic Workflows (gh-aw) is a GitHub CLI extension for creating AI-powered workflows in natural language using markdown files that compile to GitHub Actions.

## Fix Speech-to-Text Errors

Common speech-to-speech misrecognitions in technical text:

- "G H A W" / "G H dash A W" → gh-aw
- "M C P" → MCP
- "copilot see L I" / "copilot command line" → copilot-cli
- "Y A M L" / "yam L" → YAML
- "cron job" → cron
- "lock file" / "dot lock" → .lock.yml / lockfile
- "dot M D" / "markdown file" → .md
- "front matter" / "front-matter" → frontmatter
- "safe outputs" → safe-outputs
- "safe inputs" → safe-inputs
- "tool set" / "tool sets" → toolset / toolsets
- "work flow" → workflow
- "work flows" → workflows
- "cache memory" → cache-memory
- "repo memory" → repo-memory
- "web fetch" → web-fetch
- "web search" → web-search
- "play write" / "playwright tool" → playwright
- "time out minutes" → timeout-minutes
- "runs on" → runs-on
- "issue ops" → issueops
- "project ops" → projectops
- "label ops" → labelops
- "chat ops" → chatops
- "daily ops" → dailyops
- "multi repo ops" → multirepoops
- "side repo ops" → siderepoops
- "trial ops" → trialops
- "dispatch ops" → dispatchops
- "slash command" → slash_command
- "work flow dispatch" → workflow_dispatch
- "pull request" → pull_request
- "read only" → read-only
- "lock down" → lockdown
- "S A R I F" → SARIF
- "S B O M" → SBOM
- "P A T" / "personal access token" → PAT
- "fine grained" → fine-grained
- "G I T H U B underscore TOKEN" → GITHUB_TOKEN
- "G H underscore A W" → GH_AW

## Guidelines

You do not have enough background information to plan or provide code examples.
- do NOT generate code examples
- do NOT plan steps
- focus on fixing speech-to-text errors only
