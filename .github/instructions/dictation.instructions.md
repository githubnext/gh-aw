## Technical Context

GitHub Agentic Workflows (gh-aw) - a Go-based GitHub CLI extension for writing agentic workflows in natural language using markdown files with YAML frontmatter, which compile to GitHub Actions workflows.

## Rephrasing Guidelines

### Fix Ambiguous Terms

Replace speech-to-text ambiguities with correct technical terms from the glossary:

- "ghaw" → "gh-aw"
- "work flow" → "workflow"
- "front matter" → "frontmatter"
- "lock file" → "lockfile" or ".lock.yml"
- "co-pilot" → "copilot"
- "safe outputs" → "safe-outputs"
- "cache memory" → "cache-memory"
- "max turns" → "max-turns"
- "issue comment" → "issue_comment"
- "pull request" → "pull_request"
- "workflow dispatch" → "workflow_dispatch"
- "runs on" → "runs-on"
- "timeout minutes" → "timeout_minutes"

### Sentence Structure for Agentic Prompts

Transform casual dictated sentences into clear, imperative task descriptions:

**Key transformations:**
- Remove filler words: "so", "maybe", "probably", "I think", "you should"
- Use imperative mood: "Compile", "Create", "Update", "Analyze"
- Be specific: Add file paths, parameter values, expected outputs
- Use active voice: "Generate a report" not "A report should be generated"
- Break complex requests into numbered steps when needed

### Tone Adjustment

Convert casual speech into professional technical instructions:

**Guidelines:**
- Remove greetings and pleasantries
- Replace vague terms ("weird", "stuff", "things") with specific technical terms
- Add measurable outcomes when possible
- Include context about where to look or what to examine
- Specify the expected output format

### Context Enhancement

Add necessary context that might be implicit in spoken requests. Always specify file paths, commands, and expected outputs.
