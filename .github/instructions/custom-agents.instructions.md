# GitHub Custom Agent File Format

This document describes the GitHub custom agent file format used by GitHub Copilot to provide repository-specific or task-specific instructions to AI coding agents.

## Overview

GitHub Copilot supports custom agent instructions through Markdown files with YAML frontmatter. These files allow you to define specialized agent behaviors, tool access, and custom workflows that tailor Copilot's behavior to your repository's needs.

## File Locations

Custom agent files can be placed in several locations, each serving a different scope:

### 1. Repository-wide Instructions
- **File**: `.github/copilot-instructions.md`
- **Scope**: Applies to all code generation in the repository
- **Use case**: General coding standards, security requirements, testing practices

### 2. Path-specific Instructions
- **Directory**: `.github/instructions/`
- **Pattern**: `*.instructions.md` (e.g., `frontend.instructions.md`, `backend.instructions.md`)
- **Scope**: Can target specific directories or file patterns using `applyTo` in frontmatter
- **Use case**: Framework-specific guidelines, component-specific rules

### 3. Custom Agent Profiles
- **Directory**: `.github/agents/` or `.github/copilot/instructions/`
- **Pattern**: `AGENTS.md`, `*.md` (e.g., `readme-creator.md`, `test-writer.md`)
- **Scope**: Defines specialized agents with specific capabilities and instructions
- **Use case**: Task-specific agents (documentation, testing, refactoring)

### 4. agentic workflow integration
- **Location**: Imported via `imports` field in workflow frontmatter
- **Pattern**: Files ending with `.agent.md` (e.g., `my-agent.agent.md`)
- **Scope**: Custom agent for specific agentic workflow execution
- **Use case**: Workflow-specific agent configuration
- **Important**: Only one agent file (`.agent.md`) is allowed per workflow

## File Format

### Basic Structure

## Field Descriptions

### Core Fields

#### name (string, required for agent profiles)
- Unique identifier for the custom agent
- Used to reference the agent in workflows or assignments
- Convention: lowercase with hyphens (e.g., `readme-creator`, `test-writer`)

#### description (string, optional)
- Human-friendly description of the agent's focus and behavior
- Helps users understand what the agent specializes in
- Can be multi-line using YAML's `>` or `|` syntax

#### prompt (string, optional)
- Alternative to using the markdown body for instructions
- Contains freeform natural language instructions
- Use YAML's `|` (literal) or `>` (folded) for multi-line content
- If both `prompt` and markdown body exist, they are typically combined

### Tool Configuration

#### tools (array of strings, optional)
- List of tools the agent is allowed to use
- If omitted or empty, agent has access to all available tools
- Common tools include:
  - `createFile` - Create new files
  - `editFiles` - Modify existing files
  - `deleteFiles` - Remove files
  - `search` - Search codebase
  - `codeSearch` - Semantic code search
  - `runCommand` - Execute shell commands
  - `getFile` - Read file contents
  - `listFiles` - List directory contents

**Example:**
```yaml
tools:
  - editFiles
  - createFile
  - search
```

### Path Targeting

#### applyTo (array of strings, optional)
- Only used in `.instructions.md` files
- Specifies glob patterns for files/directories these instructions apply to
- Supports wildcards: `*` (any characters), `**` (any directories)
- Multiple patterns can be specified

**Example:**
```yaml
applyTo:
  - "src/frontend/**/*.tsx"
  - "src/frontend/**/*.ts"
  - "components/**"
```

### Enterprise Features

#### mcp-server (object, optional)
- Configuration for external MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers
- Typically used in enterprise or organization settings
- Allows integration with custom tools and services

**Fields:**
- `url` (string): MCP server endpoint
- `api-key` (string): Authentication key (use GitHub secrets)

**Example:**
```yaml
mcp-server:
  url: https://internal-tools.company.com/mcp
  api-key: ${{ secrets.INTERNAL_MCP_KEY }}
```

#### settings (object, optional)
- Custom runtime or connection settings
- Key-value pairs for agent-specific configuration
- Format and available keys depend on the agent implementation

## Usage Patterns

### Pattern 1: Repository-wide Standards

**File:** `.github/copilot-instructions.md`

```markdown
---
description: Repository-wide coding standards
---

# Coding Standards

## Style Guide
- Use single quotes in JavaScript/TypeScript
- Follow ESLint configuration in `.eslintrc.json`
- Maximum line length: 100 characters

## Security
- Always set `httpOnly` and `secure` flags for cookies
- Validate all user input
- Use parameterized queries for database access

## Testing
- All new code must include Jest tests
- Aim for >80% code coverage
- Test edge cases and error conditions
```

### Pattern 2: Path-specific Instructions

**File:** `.github/instructions/frontend.instructions.md`

```markdown
---
description: Frontend development guidelines
applyTo:
  - "src/frontend/**"
  - "components/**"
---

# Frontend Development Guidelines

## Component Structure
- Use React functional components with hooks
- Prefer composition over inheritance
- Keep components small and focused (< 150 lines)

## Styling
- Use CSS Modules for component styles
- Follow BEM naming convention
- Use Tailwind utility classes where appropriate

## State Management
- Use React Context for global state
- Keep local state in components when possible
- Use reducers for complex state logic
```

### Pattern 3: Custom Agent Profile

**File:** `.github/agents/readme-creator.md`

```markdown
---
name: readme-creator
description: Agent specializing in creating and improving README files
tools:
  - createFile
  - editFiles
  - search
  - getFile
---

## Test Coverage
- Write unit tests for all public functions
- Create integration tests for API endpoints
- Add edge case tests (null, undefined, empty, boundary values)
- Test error conditions and exception handling

## Test Organization
- Group related tests with `describe` blocks
- Use `beforeEach` and `afterEach` for setup/teardown
- Keep tests independent and isolated
- Mock external dependencies

## Best Practices
- One assertion per test when possible
- Use test data builders for complex objects
- Avoid test interdependence
- Keep tests fast (< 1 second each)
```

### Pattern 5: Agentic Workflow Integration

**File:** `.github/workflows/code-review.md`

```markdown
---
on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize]
permissions:
  contents: read
  pull-requests: write
engine:
  id: copilot
  custom-agent: .github/agents/code-reviewer.md
---

# Automated Code Review

Review the pull request changes and provide constructive feedback.
```

**File:** `.github/agents/code-reviewer.md`

```markdown
---
name: code-reviewer
description: Agent specialized in performing code reviews
tools:
  - search
  - codeSearch
  - getFile
---

# Code Review Agent

- Acknowledge good patterns and improvements
- Provide code examples for suggestions
```

## Integration with gh-aw

The gh-aw (GitHub Agentic Workflows) tool supports custom agent files through the `imports` field in workflow frontmatter. Agent files must have the `.agent.md` extension and be imported like other workflow components.

### Configuration

```markdown
---
on: issues
engine:
  id: copilot
imports:
  - .github/agents/my-agent.agent.md
---

# My Workflow

Instructions for the workflow...
```

### Supported Engines

Custom agent files are supported by the following engines:

1. **Copilot** - Uses `--agent <path>` flag to load custom agent file
2. **Claude** - Prepends agent file content to the workflow prompt
3. **Codex** - Prepends agent file content to the workflow prompt

### File Path Resolution

- Agent files are imported via the `imports` field
- Must end with `.agent.md` extension
- Only one agent file is allowed per workflow
- File is validated during workflow compilation
- Checkout step is automatically added if agent file is imported

### Example Workflow with Custom Agent

```markdown
---
on:
  issues:
    types: [opened]
permissions:
  contents: read
  issues: write
engine:
  id: copilot
imports:
  - .github/agents/issue-triager.agent.md
tools:
  github:
    allowed:
      - add_labels_to_issue
      - create_issue_comment
---

# Issue Triage Workflow

Analyze the issue and categorize it appropriately.
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Keep Instructions Focused
- Each agent should have a clear, specific purpose
- Avoid mixing unrelated concerns in a single agent
- Create multiple specialized agents rather than one general-purpose agent

### 2. Be Explicit and Specific
- Provide concrete examples of expected behavior
- Define clear success criteria
- Specify edge cases and error handling

### 3. Use Appropriate Scoping
- Repository-wide instructions for universal standards
- Path-specific instructions for framework or directory-specific rules
- Custom agents for task-specific workflows

### 4. Test Agent Behavior
- Verify agent follows instructions correctly
- Test with various input scenarios
- Iterate based on actual agent performance

### 5. Maintain and Update
- Keep instructions current with codebase changes
- Review and refine based on agent performance
- Remove outdated or conflicting instructions

### 6. Security Considerations
- Limit tool access to what's necessary
- Be cautious with file deletion permissions
- Use secrets for sensitive configuration
- Review agent actions regularly

## Common Patterns

### Documentation Agent
```yaml
name: documentation-specialist
description: Creates and maintains technical documentation
tools: [createFile, editFiles, search, getFile]
```

### Refactoring Agent
```yaml
name: code-refactorer
description: Improves code quality and structure
tools: [editFiles, codeSearch, search]
```

### Security Auditor
```yaml
name: security-auditor
description: Reviews code for security vulnerabilities
tools: [search, codeSearch, getFile]
```

### Migration Assistant
```yaml
name: migration-helper
description: Assists with framework or library migrations
tools: [editFiles, createFile, search, codeSearch]
```

## Troubleshooting

### Agent Not Following Instructions
- Make instructions more explicit and specific
- Provide concrete examples
- Break down complex instructions into steps
- Ensure instructions don't conflict

### Tool Access Issues
- Verify tools are listed in `tools` array
- Check agent has necessary permissions
- Ensure tools are available in the environment

### Path Targeting Not Working
- Verify glob patterns are correct
- Check file paths match patterns
- Ensure `applyTo` is only used in `.instructions.md` files

### Custom Agent File Not Found
- Verify agent file is imported in the `imports` field
- Ensure file exists and is committed
- Check file extension is `.agent.md`
- Confirm agent file path is correct in imports list
- Remember: only one agent file is allowed per workflow
