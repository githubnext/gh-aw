# GitHub Agentic Workflows Catalog
#
# This file provides a searchable catalog of available workflows organized by category.
# It enables deterministic workflow discovery for campaign creation and optimization.
#
# Usage:
#   - Campaign generators query this catalog to find matching workflows
#   - Categories help match workflows to campaign goals
#   - Keywords enable fuzzy search across workflow purposes
#
# Maintenance:
#   - Update this file when adding new workflows
#   - Keep descriptions synchronized with workflow frontmatter
#   - Add new categories as workflow types evolve

# Agentic Workflows
# These are workflows written as markdown (.md) files that use AI agents to perform tasks.
# They can interact with GitHub via safe-outputs and use various AI engines.

# Maintenance Notes:
# - This catalog should be updated whenever new workflows are added
# - Keep workflow IDs synchronized with actual .md filenames (without extension)
# - Categories can be extended as new workflow types emerge
# - Keywords should be lowercase and cover common search terms
# - Safe outputs help campaign designers understand workflow capabilities

# External Workflow Collections:
# Workflows can also be sourced from external collections like the "agentics" collection
# at https://github.com/githubnext/agentics. When suggesting workflows for campaigns,
# consider both this repository's workflows and workflows from the agentics collection.

# Usage Notes for Regular Workflows:
#
# When creating campaigns, consider these regular workflows as candidates for:
# 1. **Enhancement**: Converting to agentic workflows with AI-powered analysis
# 2. **Integration**: Combining with existing agentic workflows in campaigns
# 3. **Inspiration**: Using as templates for new agentic workflows
#
# Example campaign integration:
# - Security campaign: Combine security-scan.yml (regular) with daily-malicious-code-scan.md (agentic)
# - CI campaign: Enhance ci.yml (regular) with ci-doctor.md (agentic) for failure analysis
# - Docs campaign: Pair docs.yml and link-check.yml (regular) with glossary-maintainer.md (agentic)
