# Paths to exclude from CodeQL analysis
paths-ignore:
  # Exclude compiled workflow files (.lock.yml) as they are generated files
  # and can contain extremely long lines that cause StackOverflow errors
  # in CodeQL's regex pattern matching. These files are compiled outputs
  # from source .md files and don't need security scanning.
  - '**/*.lock.yml'
  - '.github/workflows/**/*.lock.yml'
