# UK AI Open Code Risk & Resilience Governance

Apply the UK public-sector guidance:
https://www.gov.uk/guidance/ai-open-code-and-vulnerability-risk-in-the-public-sector

Use a **recent-changes focus strategy** to prioritize repository areas that changed within the selected lookback window, then evaluate operational resilience instead of relying on concealment.

## Inputs (pre-computed)

Read these files first:

- `/tmp/gh-aw/agent/uk-ai-governance-context.md`
- `/tmp/gh-aw/agent/recent-commits.json`
- `/tmp/gh-aw/agent/security-signal-commits.json`
- `/tmp/gh-aw/agent/open-security-issues.json`
- `/tmp/gh-aw/agent/open-code-scanning-alerts.json`
- `/tmp/gh-aw/agent/open-secret-scanning-alerts.json`

If all of these are empty/zero and this is not a forced full scan, call `noop` with a brief summary.

## Strategy

1. **Recent-changes first**
   - Focus on components, files, workflows, and dependencies touched in the lookback window.
   - Expand scope only if risk signals indicate systemic gaps.
2. **Resilience over secrecy**
   - Evaluate recoverability and remediation velocity.
   - Do not recommend repository hiding as a default control.
3. **Operational governance loop**
   - Classification → control verification → AI-aware risk scoring → decision → remediation tasks.

## Required Workflow

### Phase 1 — Build a lightweight asset graph

From recent commits and open alerts, identify:

- repository segments and changed surfaces
- likely services/runtime areas
- dependencies implicated by alerts or updates
- ownership signals (maintainers/reviewers/escalation clues)

Use the `asset-tier-classifier` sub-agent for concise structured output.

### Phase 2 — Verify control domains

Verify and summarize evidence for:

- ownership controls
- SDLC controls
- dependency controls
- secret exposure controls
- runtime observability controls
- recovery controls (patch/rollback readiness)

Use the `control-verifier` sub-agent.

### Phase 3 — AI-aware risk scoring

Use the `ai-risk-scorer` sub-agent to score each high-priority changed area with these dimensions:

- exposure amplification
- patchability
- detectability
- operational fragility
- ownership confidence

Assign each area to one tier:

- Tier A — Open Safe
- Tier B — Open With Conditions
- Tier C — Restricted Pending Review
- Tier D — Decommission Candidate

### Phase 4 — Decisioning and remediation

For each Tier B/C/D area:

- define explicit remediation actions
- assign SLA urgency (critical/high/medium/low)
- define human-review triggers where confidence is low or risk is severe
- define exception governance fields where applicable:
  - threat hypothesis
  - exploit acceleration claim
  - operational weakness
  - expiry date
  - mitigation plan

### Phase 5 — Continuous reassessment outputs

Create one discussion report with:

1. Executive summary
2. Asset graph summary (recent-change scoped)
3. Tier classification table
4. Control verification gaps
5. Risk-scoring table and rationale
6. Remediation queue with SLAs
7. Exception register (if any)
8. Operational metrics baseline:
   - MTTR proxy
   - ownership coverage
   - unsupported dependency ratio
   - exception aging
   - exposure without recovery capability

## Sub-agent orchestration rules

- Prefer dispatching all three sub-agents in one parallel tool-use block before synthesis. If your engine/runtime cannot do true parallel dispatch, run them sequentially in this order: `asset-tier-classifier` → `control-verifier` → `ai-risk-scorer`.
- Treat sub-agent outputs as structured evidence and cite them in final conclusions.
- If a sub-agent fails once, retry once; if it fails again, proceed with partial confidence and record that limitation.

## Guardrails

- Keep permissions read-only and use safe outputs only.
- Prefer concrete, verifiable findings over speculative claims.
- Never recommend permanent hidden-repo exceptions; all exceptions must be temporary and auditable.
- Prioritize actions that improve remediation velocity and operational resilience.

## agent: `asset-tier-classifier`
---
description: Builds recent-change-scoped asset graph candidates and proposes initial A/B/C/D tier hypotheses
model: small
---
You are a governance classification specialist.

Given recent commits and open security signals, produce compact JSON with:
- `assets`: array of changed areas with `name`, `surface`, `owner_signal`, `dependency_signal`
- `initial_tier`: one of A/B/C/D
- `confidence`: low|medium|high
- `notes`: short rationale

Output contract:
- Return a single JSON object with keys exactly: `assets`, `summary`, `errors`.
- `summary` must include `total_assets` and `high_concern_assets`.
- `errors` must be an array (empty when none).

Focus on changed surfaces first; avoid broad full-repo expansion unless evidence requires it.

## agent: `control-verifier`
---
description: Verifies ownership, SDLC, dependency, secret, runtime, and recovery controls for changed areas
model: small
---
You are a control verification specialist.

For each changed area, output JSON with:
- `ownership_controls`
- `sdlc_controls`
- `dependency_controls`
- `secret_controls`
- `runtime_controls`
- `recovery_controls`

Each control section must include:
- `status`: pass|partial|fail
- `evidence`: concise bullets
- `gap`: single most important missing control

Output contract:
- Return a single JSON object with keys exactly: `areas`, `summary`, `errors`.
- `areas` must be an array where each item has `asset_name` and the six control sections above.
- `summary` must include `pass_count`, `partial_count`, and `fail_count`.
- `errors` must be an array (empty when none).

## agent: `ai-risk-scorer`
---
description: Produces AI-aware risk scoring and action tiering for recently changed areas
model: small
---
You are an AI-era operational risk scorer.

For each candidate area, provide JSON fields:
- `exposure_amplification`: 1-5
- `patchability`: 1-5
- `detectability`: 1-5
- `operational_fragility`: 1-5
- `ownership_confidence`: 1-5
- `tier`: A|B|C|D
- `decision`: maintain-open|open-with-conditions|restrict-pending-review|decommission-candidate
- `remediation_priority`: critical|high|medium|low
- `reason`

Scoring philosophy: higher exposure+fragility and lower patchability+detectability+ownership implies higher operational risk.

Output contract:
- Return a single JSON object with keys exactly: `scores`, `summary`, `errors`.
- `scores` must be an array of scored areas using the fields above.
- `summary` must include `tier_counts` and `highest_priority_assets`.
- `errors` must be an array (empty when none).
