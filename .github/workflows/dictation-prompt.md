# Dictation Prompt Generator

**DO NOT PLAN. Just do the work immediately.**

Scan documentation files in `docs/src/content/docs/` and update `.github/instructions/dictation.instructions.md` with approximately 100 project-specific terms (95-105 acceptable). Focus on configuration keywords, engines, commands, GitHub concepts, file formats, and tool types. Exclude tooling-specific terms like makefile, Astro, and starlight. Alphabetize the glossary.

The file should contain:
- Title: Fix text-to-speech errors in dictated text
- Project Glossary: ~100 terms, alphabetically sorted, one per line
- Technical Context: Brief description of gh-aw
- Fix Speech-to-Text Errors: Common misrecognitions â†’ correct terms

Create a pull request with title "[docs] Update dictation prompt instructions" when done.
