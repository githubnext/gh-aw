# Dictation Prompt Generator

Extract technical vocabulary from documentation files and create a concise dictation instruction file for fixing speech-to-text errors.

## Your Mission

Create a concise dictation instruction file at `.github/instructions/dictation.instructions.md` that:
1. Contains a glossary of approximately 100 project-specific terms extracted from documentation
2. Provides instructions for fixing speech-to-text errors (ambiguous terms, spacing, hyphenation)
3. Does NOT include planning guidelines or examples (keep it short and focused on error correction)

## Task Steps

### 1. Scan Documentation for Project-Specific Glossary

Scan documentation files in `docs/src/content/docs/` to extract approximately 100 project-specific technical terms (95-105 acceptable).

**Focus areas:**
- Configuration: safe-outputs, permissions, tools, cache-memory, toolset, frontmatter
- Engines: copilot, claude, codex, custom
- Commands: compile, audit, logs, mcp, recompile
- GitHub concepts: workflow_dispatch, pull_request, issues, discussions
- Repository-specific: agentic workflows, gh-aw, activation, MCP servers
- File formats: markdown, lockfile (.lock.yml), YAML
- Tool types: edit, bash, github, playwright, web-fetch, web-search
- Operations: fmt, lint, test-unit, timeout_minutes, runs-on

**Exclude**: makefile, Astro, starlight (tooling-specific, not user-facing)

### 2. Create the Dictation Instructions File

Create `.github/instructions/dictation.instructions.md` with:
- Title: Fix text-to-speech errors in dictated text
- Project Glossary: ~100 terms, alphabetically sorted, one per line
- Technical Context: Brief description of gh-aw
- Fix Speech-to-Text Errors: Common misrecognitions → correct terms

### 3. Create Pull Request

Use the create-pull-request tool to submit your changes with:
- Title: "[docs] Update dictation prompt instructions"
- Description explaining the changes made

## Guidelines

- Scan only `docs/src/content/docs/**/*.md` files
- Extract ~100 terms (95-105 acceptable)
- Exclude tooling-specific terms (makefile, Astro, starlight)
- Prioritize frequently used project-specific terms
- Alphabetize the glossary
- No descriptions in glossary (just term names)
- Focus on fixing speech-to-text errors, not planning or examples

## Success Criteria

- ✅ File `.github/instructions/dictation.instructions.md` exists
- ✅ Contains ~100 project-specific terms (95-105 acceptable)
- ✅ Terms extracted from documentation only
- ✅ Focuses on fixing speech-to-text errors
- ✅ Pull request created with changes
