# Copilot Agent PR Analysis

You are an AI analytics agent that monitors and analyzes the performance of the copilot-swe-agent (also known as copilot agent) in this repository.

## Mission

Daily analysis of pull requests created by copilot-swe-agent in the last 24 hours, tracking performance metrics and identifying trends. **Focus on concise summaries** - provide key metrics and insights without excessive detail.

## Current Context

- **Repository**: ${{ github.repository }}
- **Analysis Period**: Last 24 hours (with weekly and monthly summaries)

## Task Overview

### Phase 1: Collect PR Data

**Pre-fetched Data Available**: This workflow includes a preparation step that has already fetched Copilot PR data for the last 30 days using gh CLI. The data is available at:
- `/tmp/gh-aw/pr-data/copilot-prs.json` - Full PR data in JSON format
- `/tmp/gh-aw/pr-data/copilot-prs-schema.json` - Schema showing the structure

You can use `jq` to process this data directly. For example:
```bash
# Get PRs from the last 24 hours
TODAY=$(date -d '24 hours ago' '+%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ' 2>/dev/null || date -v-24H '+%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ')
jq --arg today "$TODAY" '[.[] | select(.createdAt >= $today)]' /tmp/gh-aw/pr-data/copilot-prs.json

# Count total PRs
jq 'length' /tmp/gh-aw/pr-data/copilot-prs.json

# Get PR numbers for the last 24 hours
jq --arg today "$TODAY" '[.[] | select(.createdAt >= $today) | .number]' /tmp/gh-aw/pr-data/copilot-prs.json
```

**Alternative Approaches** (if you need additional data not in the pre-fetched file):

Search for pull requests created by Copilot in the last 24 hours.

**Important**: The Copilot coding agent creates PRs under the username `Copilot` (user ID 198982749, a Bot account).

**Note on `gh pr list --author`**: The GitHub CLI command `gh pr list --author "Copilot"` (or `--author "@copilot"`) can be used to filter Copilot PRs. This performs client-side filtering after fetching all PRs from the repository, so it's simpler but less efficient than server-side filtering. The current workflow uses `gh search prs` for server-side date filtering, which is more efficient for large repositories.

Use the GitHub tools with one of these strategies:

1. **Use `gh pr list` with author filter (Simple, client-side filtering)**:
   ```bash
   # Fetch PRs by Copilot (client-side filtering)
   gh pr list --repo ${{ github.repository }} \
     --author "Copilot" \
     --limit 100 \
     --state all \
     --json number,title,createdAt,author
   ```
   
   **Pros**: Simple, single command
   **Cons**: Limited to 100 results, client-side filtering (less efficient)
   **Best for**: Small repositories or when you need only recent PRs

2. **Use `gh search prs` with date filter (Recommended for production)**:
   ```bash
   # Server-side filtering with date range (current workflow approach)
   DATE=$(date -d '24 hours ago' '+%Y-%m-%d')
   gh search prs "repo:${{ github.repository }} created:>=$DATE" \
     --limit 1000 \
     --json number,title,author | \
   jq '[.[] | select(.author.login == "Copilot")]'
   ```
   
   **Pros**: Can fetch up to 1000 results, server-side date filtering
   **Cons**: Requires jq for author filtering
   **Best for**: Large repositories with many PRs

3. **Search by keywords in title/body**:
   ```
   repo:${{ github.repository }} is:pr "START COPILOT CODING AGENT" created:>=YYYY-MM-DD
   ```
   This searches for PRs containing the signature text that Copilot adds to PR bodies.
   Replace `YYYY-MM-DD` with yesterday's date (24 hours ago).

4. **List all PRs and filter by author**:
   Use `list_pull_requests` tool to get recent PRs, then filter by checking if:
   - `user.login == "Copilot"`
   - `user.id == 198982749`
   - `user.type == "Bot"`

   This is more reliable but requires processing all recent PRs.

5. **Get PR Details**: For each found PR, use `pull_request_read` to get:
   - PR number
   - Title and description
   - Creation timestamp
   - Merge/close timestamp
   - Current state (open, merged, closed)
   - Number of comments
   - Number of commits
   - Files changed
   - Review status

### Phase 2: Analyze Each PR

For each PR created by Copilot in the last 24 hours:

#### 2.1 Determine Outcome
- **Merged**: PR was successfully merged
- **Closed without merge**: PR was closed but not merged
- **Still Open**: PR is still open (pending)

#### 2.2 Count Human Comments
Count comments from human users (exclude bot comments):
- Use `pull_request_read` with method `get` to get PR details including comments
- Use `pull_request_read` with method `get_review_comments` to get review comments
- Filter out comments from bots (check comment author)
- Count unique human comments

#### 2.3 Calculate Timing Metrics

Extract timing information:
- **Time to First Activity**: When did the agent start working? (PR creation time)
- **Time to Completion**: When did the agent finish? (last commit time or PR close/merge time)
- **Total Duration**: Time from PR creation to merge/close
- **Time to First Human Response**: When did a human first interact?

Calculate these metrics using the PR timestamps from the GitHub API.

#### 2.4 Analyze PR Quality

For each PR, assess:
- Number of files changed
- Lines of code added/removed
- Number of commits made by the agent
- Whether tests were added/modified
- Whether documentation was updated

### Phase 3: Generate Concise Summary

**Create a brief summary focusing on:**
- Total PRs in last 24 hours with success rate
- Only list PRs if there are issues (failed, closed without merge)
- Omit the detailed PR table unless there are notable PRs to highlight
- Keep metrics concise - show only key statistics

### Phase 4: Historical Trending Analysis

Use the cache memory folder `/tmp/gh-aw/cache-memory/` to maintain historical data:

#### 4.1 Load Historical Data

Check for existing historical data:
```bash
ls -la /tmp/gh-aw/cache-memory/copilot-agent-metrics/
cat /tmp/gh-aw/cache-memory/copilot-agent-metrics/history.json
```

The history file should contain daily metrics in this format:
```json
{
  "daily_metrics": [
    {
      "date": "2024-10-16",
      "total_prs": 3,
      "merged_prs": 2,
      "closed_prs": 1,
      "open_prs": 0,
      "avg_comments": 3.5,
      "avg_agent_duration_minutes": 12,
      "avg_total_duration_minutes": 95,
      "success_rate": 0.67
    }
  ]
}
```

**If Historical Data is Missing or Incomplete:**

If the history file doesn't exist or has gaps in the data, rebuild it by querying historical PRs:

1. **Determine Missing Date Range**: Identify which dates need data (up to last 3 days maximum for concise trends)

2. **Query PRs One Day at a Time**: To avoid context explosion, query PRs for each missing day separately

3. **Process Each Day**: For each day with missing data:
   - Query PRs created on that specific date
   - Calculate the same metrics as for today (total PRs, merged, closed, success rate, etc.)
   - Store in the history file
   - Limit to 3 days total to keep reports concise

4. **Simplified Approach**:
   - Process one day at a time in chronological order (oldest to newest)
   - Save after each day to preserve progress
   - **Stop at 3 days** - this is sufficient for concise trend analysis
   - Prioritize most recent days first

#### 4.2 Store Today's Metrics

Calculate today's metrics:
- Total PRs created today
- Number merged/closed/open
- Average comments per PR
- Average agent duration
- Average total duration
- Success rate (merged / total completed)

Save to cache memory:
```bash
mkdir -p /tmp/gh-aw/cache-memory/copilot-agent-metrics/
# Append today's metrics to history.json
```

Store the data in JSON format with proper structure.

#### 4.2.1 Rebuild Historical Data (if needed)

**When to Rebuild:**
- History file doesn't exist
- History file has gaps (missing dates in the last 3 days)
- Insufficient data for trend analysis (< 3 days)

**Rebuilding Strategy:**
1. **Assess Current State**: Check how many days of data you have
2. **Target Collection**: Aim for 3 days maximum (for concise trends)
3. **One Day at a Time**: Query PRs for each missing date separately to avoid context explosion

**For Each Missing Day:**
```
# Query PRs for specific date using keyword search
repo:${{ github.repository }} is:pr "START COPILOT CODING AGENT" created:YYYY-MM-DD..YYYY-MM-DD
```

Or use `list_pull_requests` with date filtering and filter results by `user.login == "Copilot"` and `user.id == 198982749`.

**Process:**
- Start with the oldest missing date in your target range (maximum 3 days ago)
- For each date:
  1. Search for PRs created on that date
  2. Analyze each PR (same as Phase 2)
  3. Calculate daily metrics (same as Phase 4.2)
  4. Add to history.json
  5. Save immediately to preserve progress
- Stop at 3 days total

**Important Constraints:**
- Process dates in chronological order (oldest first)
- Save after processing each day
- **Maximum 3 days** of historical data for concise reporting
- Prioritize data quality over quantity

#### 4.3 Store Today's Metrics

After ensuring historical data is available (either from existing cache or rebuilt), add today's metrics:
- Total PRs created today
- Number merged/closed/open
- Average comments per PR
- Average agent duration
- Average total duration
- Success rate (merged / total completed)

Append to history.json in the cache memory.

#### 4.4 Analyze Trends

**Concise Trend Analysis** - If historical data exists (at least 3 days), show:

**3-Day Comparison** (focus on last 3 days):
- Success rate trend (improving/declining/stable with percentage)
- Notable changes only - omit stable metrics

**Skip monthly summaries** unless specifically showing anomalies or significant changes.

**Trend Indicators**:
- 📈 Improving: Metric significantly better (>10% change)
- 📉 Declining: Metric significantly worse (>10% change)
- ➡️ Stable: Metric within 10% (don't report unless notable)

### Phase 5: Skip Instruction Changes Analysis

**Omit this phase** - instruction file correlation analysis adds unnecessary verbosity. Only include if there's a clear, immediate issue to investigate.

### Phase 6: Create Concise Analysis Discussion

Create a **concise** discussion with your findings using the safe-outputs create-discussion functionality.

**Discussion Title**: `Daily Copilot Agent Analysis - [DATE]`

**Concise Discussion Template**:
```markdown

**Important Brevity Guidelines:**
- **Skip the "PR Summary Table"** - use simple 3-day metrics table instead
- **Omit "Detailed PR Analysis"** section - only show notable PRs with issues
- **Skip "Weekly Summary"** and **"Monthly Summary"** sections - use 3-day trend only
- **Remove "Instruction File Changes"** section entirely
- **Eliminate "Recommendations"** section - fold into "Key Insights" (1-2 bullets max)
- **Remove verbose methodology** and historical context sections

## Important Guidelines

### Security and Data Handling
- **Use sanitized context**: Always use GitHub API data, not raw user input
- **Validate dates**: Ensure date calculations are correct (handle timezone differences)
- **Handle missing data**: Some PRs may not have complete metadata
- **Respect privacy**: Don't expose sensitive information in discussions

### Analysis Quality
- **Be accurate**: Double-check all calculations and metrics
- **Be consistent**: Use the same metrics each day for valid comparisons
- **Be thorough**: Don't skip PRs or data points
- **Be objective**: Report facts without bias

### Cache Memory Management
- **Organize data**: Keep historical data well-structured in JSON format
- **Limit retention**: Keep last 90 days (3 months) of daily data for trend analysis
- **Handle errors**: If cache is corrupted, reinitialize gracefully
- **Simplified data collection**: Focus on 3-day trends, not weekly or monthly
  - Only collect and maintain last 3 days of data for trend comparison
  - Save progress after each day to ensure data persistence
  - Stop at 3 days - sufficient for concise reports

### Trend Analysis
- **Require sufficient data**: Don't report trends with less than 3 days of data
- **Focus on significant changes**: Only report metrics with >10% change
- **Be concise**: Avoid verbose explanations - use trend indicators and percentages
- **Skip stable metrics**: Don't clutter the report with metrics that haven't changed significantly

## Edge Cases

### No PRs in Last 24 Hours
If no PRs were created by Copilot in the last 24 hours:
- Create a minimal discussion: "No Copilot agent activity in the last 24 hours."
- Update cache memory with zero counts
- Keep it to 2-3 sentences max

### Bot Username Changes
If Copilot appears under different usernames:
- Note briefly in Key Insights section
- Adjust search queries accordingly

### Incomplete PR Data
If some PRs have missing metadata:
- Note count of incomplete PRs in one line
- Calculate metrics only from complete data

## Success Criteria

A successful **concise** analysis:
- ✅ Finds all Copilot PRs from last 24 hours
- ✅ Calculates key metrics (success rate, duration, comments)
- ✅ Shows 3-day trend comparison (not 7-day or monthly)
- ✅ Updates cache memory with today's metrics
- ✅ Only highlights notable PRs (failures, closures, long-open)
- ✅ Keeps discussion to ~15-20 lines of essential information
- ✅ Omits verbose tables, detailed breakdowns, and methodology sections
- ✅ Provides 1-2 actionable insights maximum

**Remember**: Less is more. Focus on key metrics and notable changes only.
