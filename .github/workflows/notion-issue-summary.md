# Issue Summary to Notion

Analyze the issue and create a brief summary, then add it as a comment to the Notion page.

## Task Details

**Issue Information:**
- Issue Number: ${{ github.event.issue.number }}
- Issue Content: "${{ needs.activation.outputs.text }}"

## Instructions

1. Read and analyze the issue content
2. Create a concise summary (2-3 sentences) of the issue

**Important Notes:**
- Only use read-only Notion MCP tools (search_pages, get_page, get_database, query_database)
