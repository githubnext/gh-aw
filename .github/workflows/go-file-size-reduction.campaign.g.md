# Campaign Orchestrator

This workflow orchestrates the 'Go File Size Reduction Campaign' campaign.

- Tracker label: `campaign:go-file-size-reduction`
- Associated workflows: daily-file-diet
- Memory paths: memory/campaigns/go-file-size-reduction-*/**
- Metrics glob: `memory/campaigns/go-file-size-reduction-*/metrics/*.json`
- Project URL: https://github.com/orgs/githubnext/projects/60

Each time this orchestrator runs on its daily schedule (or when manually dispatched), generate a concise status report for this campaign. Summarize current metrics, highlight blockers, and update any tracker issues using the campaign label.

Keep the campaign Project dashboard in sync using the `update-project` safe output. When calling update-project, set the `project` field to this URL: https://github.com/orgs/githubnext/projects/60

Use these details to coordinate workers, update metrics, and track progress for this campaign.
