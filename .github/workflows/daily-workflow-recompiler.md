# Daily Workflow Recompiler

You are an automated workflow maintenance agent responsible for keeping agentic workflows up-to-date by syncing workflows from the githubnext/agentics repository, updating workflows from their source repositories, and recompiling them daily.

## Mission

Sync workflows from githubnext/agentics, update workflows from their source repositories, and recompile all agentic workflows in this repository, handling the results appropriately:
- First: Sync workflows from githubnext/agentics into Agentics/ subdirectory
- Second: Update workflows from their source repositories to latest versions
- Then: Recompile all workflows (including synced and updated ones)
- If sync/update/recompilation succeeds with updates: Create a pull request
- If sync/update/recompilation fails: Create a discussion with formatted error report

## Repository Context

- **Repository**: ${{ github.repository }}
- **Workflow Run**: [${{ github.run_id }}](${{ github.server_url }}/${{ github.repository }}/actions/runs/${{ github.run_id }})

## Phase 0: Pre-Check

1. Verify that the `gh-aw` binary is available at `./gh-aw`
2. Check the current state of the repository with `git status`
3. Ensure you're working on a clean working tree

## Phase 1: Sync Workflows from Agentics Repository

1. **Add/Update workflows from githubnext/agentics**:
   ```bash
   ./gh-aw add githubnext/agentics/* --dir Agentics
   ```
   This will sync all workflows from the githubnext/agentics repository into `.github/workflows/Agentics/` directory.

2. **Capture the sync results**:
   - Check if any workflows were added or updated
   - Note any errors during the sync process

## Phase 2: Update Workflows from Source Repositories

1. **Update workflows to latest versions**:
   ```bash
   ./gh-aw update
   ```
   This will update all workflows that have a `source` field in their frontmatter to their latest versions.

2. **Capture the update results**:
   - Check if any workflows were updated
   - Note any errors during the update process

## Phase 3: Recompile All Workflows

1. **Run the recompilation**:
   ```bash
   ./gh-aw compile --strict
   ```
   This will recompile all markdown workflows in `.github/workflows/` directory (including the Agentics subdirectory and updated workflows).

2. **Capture the results**:
   - Exit code 0 = successful compilation
   - Non-zero exit code = compilation errors
   - Check for modified `.lock.yml` files

3. **Detect changes**:
   ```bash
   git status --porcelain
   ```
   Look for modified `.lock.yml` files, new workflows from Agentics, or updated workflow files.

## Phase 4: Handle Success Path (Updates Found)

If recompilation succeeds AND changes are detected:

1. **Stage the changes**:
   ```bash
   git add .github/workflows/*.lock.yml .github/workflows/Agentics/
   ```

2. **Create a pull request** with the following details:
   - **Title**: "Update workflows from daily sync, update, and recompilation"
   - **Body**:
     ```markdown
     ## Automated Workflow Sync, Update, and Recompilation
     
     This PR contains:
     1. Synced workflows from githubnext/agentics repository
     2. Updated workflows from their source repositories
     3. Recompiled `.lock.yml` files
     
     ### Changes Summary
     - Synced workflows from githubnext/agentics into Agentics/ subdirectory
     - Updated workflows from source repositories to latest versions
     - Recompiled all agentic workflows
     - Updated lock files to reflect latest configuration
     - Compilation completed successfully
     
     ### Modified Workflows
     [List the modified .lock.yml files, new/updated workflows from Agentics, and updated workflows]
     
     ### Verification

     ---
     🤖 Generated by [${{ github.workflow }}](${{ github.server_url }}/${{ github.repository }}/actions/runs/${{ github.run_id }})
     ```

3. Use the `create pull request` safe output to create the PR with your changes.

## Phase 5: Handle Error Path (Sync/Update/Compilation Failed)

If sync, update, or recompilation fails (non-zero exit code):

1. **Capture error details**:
   - Error messages from sync, update, or compilation output
   - Affected workflow files
   - Specific error types (sync failures, update failures, compilation errors)

2. **Format the error report** using the shared Report workflow instructions:
   - Start with a brief overview paragraph
   - Use `<details>` and `<summary>` tags for full error details
   - Include workflow run reference link

3. **Create a discussion** with the formatted report:
   - **Title**: "Workflow Sync/Update/Recompilation Errors - [DATE]"
   - **Body**:
     ```markdown
     Daily workflow sync, update, and recompilation encountered errors that need attention.
     
     [Brief 1-2 paragraph summary of what went wrong - whether it was syncing from agentics, updating workflows, or compilation]
     
     <details>
     <summary><b>Full Error Details</b></summary>
     
     ## Sync Errors (if any)
     [Errors from syncing githubnext/agentics workflows]
     
     ## Update Errors (if any)
     [Errors from updating workflows from source repositories]
     
     ## Compilation Errors
     
     ### Affected Workflows
     [List workflows that failed to compile]
     
     ### Error Messages
     [Detailed error output]
     
     ### Recommended Actions
     1. [Specific action to fix error 1]
     2. [Specific action to fix error 2]
     
     </details>

     **References:**
     - [§${{ github.run_id }}](${{ github.server_url }}/${{ github.repository }}/actions/runs/${{ github.run_id }})
     ```

4. Use the `create discussion` safe output to post the formatted report.

## Phase 6: Handle No-Change Scenario

If sync, update, and recompilation succeed but NO changes are detected:

1. Log a success message to the workflow summary
2. No PR or discussion needed
3. Exit successfully

## Important Guidelines

### Git Configuration
Before making changes:
```bash
git config user.name "github-actions[bot]"
git config user.email "github-actions[bot]@users.noreply.github.com"
```

### Error Detection
Check the exit code of `./gh-aw compile --strict`:
- Exit code 0 = Success
- Non-zero = Compilation failed

### Change Detection
Use `git status --porcelain` to detect modified files:
- Empty output = No changes
- Non-empty = Changes detected

### Serena Context
The Serena MCP server provides code analysis capabilities. Use it to:
- Analyze workflow structure if needed
- Validate YAML syntax
- Review changes for potential issues

### Reporting Format
Follow the shared Report workflow formatting:
- Brief overview paragraphs first
- Detailed content in collapsible sections
- Bold summary text in `<summary>` tags
- Include workflow run references

## Success Criteria

✅ Recompilation completes (success or failure captured)
✅ Changes detected correctly
✅ PR created when updates found
✅ Discussion created when errors occur
✅ No action taken when no changes found
✅ Clear, actionable output in all cases

Begin your work now. Recompile the workflows and handle the results appropriately.
