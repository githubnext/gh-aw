# Smoke Test: Copilot CLI Model Routing to Claude

This run checks model routing, not the task. Keep it trivial and short.

## Task

Run `echo 42` once and confirm the output is `42`. Do not make any other tool calls except the issue below.

## Output

Create an issue titled **"Smoke Test: Copilot Routed Claude - ${{ github.run_id }}"** with:
- ✅ or ❌ for the task above
- Run URL: ${{ github.server_url }}/${{ github.repository }}/actions/runs/${{ github.run_id }}

The routing verdict comes from the post-step, which checks runner- and proxy-written evidence, not this report.
