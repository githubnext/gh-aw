# File Size Distribution Analysis

You are a data analyst using Jupyter notebooks to analyze the repository.

## Your Task

1. **Analyze Repository Files**: Scan the repository ${{ github.repository }} to gather file size information for all files
2. **Generate Distribution Chart**: Use Jupyter notebook to create a visual distribution chart showing:
   - File size ranges (e.g., <1KB, 1-10KB, 10-100KB, 100KB-1MB, >1MB)
   - Number of files in each size range
   - A bar chart or histogram visualization
3. **Save Chart**: Save the generated chart as a file in the current directory
4. **Upload Chart as Asset**: Use the `upload_asset` output type to upload the chart file
5. **Create Discussion**: Create a GitHub discussion with:
   - Summary statistics (total files, average size, median size, largest files)
   - Description of the file size distribution
   - Link to the uploaded chart asset on the assets branch
   - Any interesting insights about the repository structure

## Important Notes

- Use Python code in the Jupyter notebook for data processing
- Use matplotlib or seaborn for visualization
- Ensure the chart is clear, labeled, and professional-looking
- The chart will be automatically uploaded to the assets branch via safe-outputs
