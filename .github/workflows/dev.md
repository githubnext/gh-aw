# Add Emoji to File

Create or update an `emoji.md` file with an emoji and push the changes to the pull request branch.

**Instructions**: 

Use the `edit` tool to either create a new `emoji.md` file or update the existing one if it already exists. Choose a fun, creative emoji that represents GitHub Agentic Workflows.

Commit your changes.

Call the `push-to-pull-request-branch` tool after making your changes.

**Example emoji file structure:**
```markdown
# Emoji for Agentic Workflows

ðŸ¤–âœ¨
```
