# Quote of the Day

Fetch a quote of the day and push it to `docs/quotes.md` in the pull request branch.

## Instructions

1. Fetch a quote of the day from a free API (e.g., https://api.quotable.io/random or similar)
2. Format the quote nicely in markdown with the author and date
3. Write the quote to `docs/quotes.md`
4. The file should contain:
   - The quote text
   - The author
   - Today's date
   - Formatted in clean markdown

Example format:
```markdown
# Quote of the Day

**Date**: [current date]

> [quote text]

â€” **[author]**
```

5. Use the push-to-pull-request-branch safe output to commit the changes
