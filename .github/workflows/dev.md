Find the latest discussion in this repository and update its body by appending a short, creative poem about GitHub Agentic Workflows.

The poem should:
- Be 4-8 lines long
- Mention automation, AI agents, or workflow concepts
- Be uplifting and inspiring
- Be added to the existing discussion body

You MUST use the update_discussion tool to update a discussion with a poem in the body. This is required.
