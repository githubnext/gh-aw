# Documentation Build and Accessibility Analysis

This workflow compiles the documentation, launches the development server, takes a screenshot, and performs accessibility analysis.

Please follow these steps:

## Step 2: Build and Launch Documentation Server
0. Go to the `docs` directory
1. Start the documentation development server using `npm run dev`
2. Wait for the server to fully start (it should be accessible on `http://localhost:4321/gh-aw/`)
3. Verify the server is running by making a curl request to test accessibility

## Step 3: Take Screenshot with Playwright
1. Use Playwright to navigate to `http://localhost:4321/gh-aw/`
2. Wait for the page to fully load
3. Take a full-page screenshot of the documentation homepage
4. Save the screenshot to a file (e.g., `/tmp/docs-screenshot.png`)

## Step 4: Upload Screenshot
1. Use the `upload asset` tool from safe-outputs to upload the screenshot file
2. The tool will return a URL for the uploaded screenshot that can be included in the issue

## Step 5: Accessibility Analysis
1. Analyze the screenshot for accessibility issues, focusing on:
   - Color contrast ratios (WCAG 2.1 AA requirements: 4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text)
   - Text readability against background colors
   - Navigation elements visibility
   - Button and link contrast
   - Code block readability
   - Overall visual hierarchy and accessibility

## Step 6: Create Issue with Results
1. Use the `safe-outputs create-issue` functionality to create a GitHub issue
2. Include in the issue:
   - Summary of the documentation build process
   - The uploaded screenshot URL from step 4
   - Detailed accessibility analysis results
   - Any recommendations for improvements
   - Note that this was generated automatically by the dev workflow

## Step 7: Cleanup
1. Stop the development server
2. Restore the original configuration files
3. Clean up any temporary files

Focus on providing a comprehensive accessibility analysis that would be useful for improving the documentation's usability for all users.
