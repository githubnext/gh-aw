# Test GitHub MCP Tools and Create Emoji File

Test each GitHub MCP tool with sensible arguments to verify they are configured properly, then create or update an emoji.md file with an emoji and push it to the pull request branch.

**Goal**: 
1. Invoke each tool from the GitHub MCP server with reasonable arguments. Some tools may fail due to missing data or invalid arguments, but they should at least be callable. Fail if there are permission issues indicating the tools aren't properly configured.
2. Create or update an `emoji.md` file in the repository with an emoji and push the changes to the pull request branch.

## Instructions

**Part 1: Discover and test all available GitHub MCP tools:**

1. First, explore and identify all tools available from the GitHub MCP server
2. For each discovered tool, invoke it with sensible arguments based on the repository context (${{ github.repository }})
3. Use appropriate parameters for each tool (e.g., repository name, issue numbers, PR numbers, etc.)

Example tools you should discover and test may include (but are not limited to):
- Context tools: `get_me`, etc.
- Repository tools: `get_file_contents`, `list_branches`, `list_commits`, `search_repositories`, etc.
- Issues tools: `list_issues`, `search_issues`, `issue_read`, etc.
- Pull Request tools: `list_pull_requests`, `get_pull_request`, `search_pull_requests`, etc.
- Actions tools: `list_workflows`, `list_workflow_runs`, etc.
- Release tools: `list_releases`, etc.
- And any other tools you discover from the GitHub MCP server

## Expected Behavior for Part 1

- Each tool should be invoked successfully, even if it returns empty results or errors due to data not existing
- If a tool cannot be called due to **permission issues** (e.g., "tool not allowed", "permission denied", "unauthorized"), the task should **FAIL** 
- If a tool fails due to invalid arguments or missing data (e.g., "resource not found", "invalid parameters"), that's acceptable - continue to the next tool
- Log the results of each tool invocation (success or failure reason)

## Part 1 Summary

After testing all tools, provide a summary:
- Total tools tested: [count]
- Successfully invoked: [count]
- Failed due to missing data/invalid args: [count]  
- Failed due to permission issues: [count] - **FAIL if > 0**

If any permission issues were encountered, clearly state which tools had permission problems and fail the workflow.

## Part 2: Create or Update Emoji File

After completing the tool testing, create or update an `emoji.md` file in the repository root. The file should:

1. **Contain an emoji** - Choose a fun, creative emoji that represents GitHub Agentic Workflows
2. **Be in markdown format** - Use proper markdown formatting
3. **Include a title** - Use a markdown heading for the file

**Instructions**: Use the `edit` tool to either create a new `emoji.md` file or update the existing one if it already exists. The changes will be automatically pushed to the pull request branch.

**Example emoji file structure:**
```markdown
# Emoji for Agentic Workflows

```
