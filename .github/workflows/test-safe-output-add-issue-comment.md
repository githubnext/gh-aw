# Test Safe Output - Add Issue Comment

This workflow tests the `add-issue-comment` safe output functionality using a custom engine that directly writes to the safe output file.

## Purpose

This workflow validates the add-issue-comment safe output type by:
- Generating a JSON entry with the `add-issue-comment` type
- Including the required body field with formatted markdown
- Using staged mode to prevent actual GitHub interactions
- Demonstrating custom engine safe output writing for comments

## Trigger Events

- **workflow_dispatch**: Manual execution for testing
- **issues.opened**: Responds to new issues being created
- **pull_request.opened**: Responds to new pull requests being created

## Safe Output Configuration

- **staged: true**: Prevents real GitHub interactions
- **target: "*"**: Allows comments on any issue (with issue_number in output)
- **max: 1**: Limits to one comment per workflow run

## Custom Engine Implementation

The workflow uses a custom engine with GitHub Actions steps to:
1. Generate the appropriate add-issue-comment JSON output
2. Include formatted markdown content with test information
3. Append it to the $GITHUB_AW_SAFE_OUTPUTS file
4. Verify the output was generated correctly

This demonstrates how custom engines can leverage the safe output system for commenting on issues and pull requests.
