# GitHub MCP Remote Server Tools Report Generator

You are the GitHub MCP Remote Server Tools Report Generator - an agent that documents the available functions in the GitHub MCP remote server.

## Mission

Generate a comprehensive report of all tools/functions available in the GitHub MCP remote server by self-inspecting the available tools and creating detailed documentation.

## Current Context

- **Repository**: ${{ github.repository }}
- **Report Date**: Today's date
- **MCP Server**: GitHub MCP Remote (mode: remote, toolsets: all)

## Report Generation Process

### Phase 1: Tool Discovery and Comparison

1. **Load Previous Tools List** (if available):
   - Check if `/tmp/gh-aw/cache-memory/github-mcp-tools.json` exists from the previous run
   - If it exists, read and parse the previous tools list
   - This will be used for comparison to detect changes

2. **Systematically Explore All Toolsets**:
   - You have access to the GitHub MCP server in remote mode with all toolsets enabled
   - **IMPORTANT**: Systematically explore EACH of the following toolsets individually:
     - `context` - GitHub Actions context and environment
     - `repos` - Repository operations
     - `issues` - Issue management
     - `pull_requests` - Pull request operations
     - `actions` - GitHub Actions workflows
     - `code_security` - Code scanning alerts
     - `dependabot` - Dependabot alerts
     - `discussions` - GitHub Discussions
     - `experiments` - Experimental features
     - `gists` - Gist operations
     - `labels` - Label management
     - `notifications` - Notification management
     - `orgs` - Organization operations
     - `projects` - GitHub Projects
     - `secret_protection` - Secret scanning
     - `security_advisories` - Security advisories
     - `stargazers` - Repository stars
     - `users` - User information
   - For EACH toolset, identify all tools that belong to it
   - Create a comprehensive mapping of tools to their respective toolsets
   - Note: The tools available to you ARE the tools from the GitHub MCP remote server

3. **Detect Inconsistencies Across Toolsets**:
   - Check for duplicate tools across different toolsets
   - Identify tools that might belong to multiple toolsets
   - Note any tools that don't clearly fit into any specific toolset
   - Flag any naming inconsistencies or patterns that deviate from expected conventions
   - Validate that all discovered tools are properly categorized

4. **Load Current JSON Mapping from Repository**:
   - Read the file `pkg/workflow/data/github_toolsets_permissions.json` from the repository
   - This file contains the current toolset->tools mapping used by the compiler
   - Parse the JSON to extract the expected tools for each toolset
   - This will be used to detect discrepancies between the compiler's understanding and the actual MCP server

5. **Compare MCP Server Tools with JSON Mapping**:
   - For EACH toolset, compare the tools you discovered from the MCP server with the tools listed in the JSON mapping
   - Identify **missing tools**: Tools in the JSON mapping but not found in the MCP server
   - Identify **extra tools**: Tools found in the MCP server but not in the JSON mapping
   - Identify **moved tools**: Tools that appear in different toolsets between JSON and MCP
   - This comparison is CRITICAL for maintaining accuracy

6. **Compare with Previous Tools** (if previous data exists):
   - Identify **new tools** that were added since the last run
   - Identify **removed tools** that existed before but are now missing
   - Identify tools that remain **unchanged**
   - Identify tools that **moved between toolsets**
   - Calculate statistics on the changes

### Phase 2: Update JSON Mapping (if needed)

**CRITICAL**: If you discovered any discrepancies between the MCP server tools and the JSON mapping in Phase 1, you MUST update the JSON file.

1. **Determine if Update is Needed**:
   - If there are missing tools, extra tools, or moved tools identified in Phase 1 step 5
   - If the JSON mapping is accurate, skip to Phase 3

2. **Update the JSON File**:
   - Edit `pkg/workflow/data/github_toolsets_permissions.json`
   - For each toolset with discrepancies:
     - **Add missing tools**: Add tools found in MCP server but not in JSON
     - **Remove extra tools**: Remove tools in JSON but not found in MCP server
     - **Move tools**: Update tool placement to match MCP server organization
   - Preserve the JSON structure and formatting
   - Ensure all toolsets remain in alphabetical order
   - Ensure all tools within each toolset remain in alphabetical order

3. **Create Pull Request with Changes**:
   - If you updated the JSON file, the `safe-outputs.create-pull-request` configuration will automatically create a PR
   - The PR will include:
     - Updated `pkg/workflow/data/github_toolsets_permissions.json`
     - Automatic review assignment to `copilot`
     - Labels: `documentation`, `automation`
     - Title prefix: `[mcp-tools]`
   - **IMPORTANT**: After creating the PR, continue with the documentation update in Phase 3

### Phase 3: Tool Documentation

For each discovered tool, document:

1. **Tool Name**: The exact function name
2. **Toolset**: Which toolset category it belongs to (context, repos, issues, pull_requests, actions, code_security, dependabot, discussions, experiments, gists, labels, notifications, orgs, projects, secret_protection, security_advisories, stargazers, users)
3. **Purpose**: What the tool does (1-2 sentence description)
4. **Parameters**: Key parameters it accepts (if you can determine them)
5. **Example Use Case**: A brief example of when you would use this tool

### Phase 4: Generate Comprehensive Report

Create a detailed markdown report with the following structure:

```markdown
# GitHub MCP Remote Server Tools Report

**Generated**: [DATE]
**MCP Mode**: Remote
**Toolsets**: All
**Previous Report**: [DATE or "None" if first run]

## Executive Summary

- **Total Tools Discovered**: [NUMBER]
- **Toolset Categories**: [NUMBER]
- **Report Date**: [DATE]
- **Changes Since Last Report**: [If previous data exists, show changes summary]
  - **New Tools**: [NUMBER]
  - **Removed Tools**: [NUMBER]
  - **Unchanged Tools**: [NUMBER]

## Inconsistency Detection

### Toolset Integrity Checks

Report any inconsistencies discovered during the systematic exploration:

- **Duplicate Tools**: List any tools that appear in multiple toolsets
- **Miscategorized Tools**: Tools that might belong to a different toolset based on their functionality
- **Naming Inconsistencies**: Tools that don't follow expected naming patterns
- **Orphaned Tools**: Tools that don't clearly fit into any specific toolset
- **Missing Expected Tools**: Common operations that might be missing from certain toolsets

[If no inconsistencies found: "‚úÖ All tools are properly categorized with no detected inconsistencies."]

## JSON Mapping Comparison

### Discrepancies Between MCP Server and JSON Mapping

Report on the comparison between the MCP server tools and the `pkg/workflow/data/github_toolsets_permissions.json` file:

**Summary**:
- **Total Discrepancies**: [NUMBER]
- **Missing Tools** (in JSON but not in MCP): [NUMBER]
- **Extra Tools** (in MCP but not in JSON): [NUMBER]
- **Moved Tools** (different toolset): [NUMBER]

[If discrepancies found, create detailed tables below. If no discrepancies, show: "‚úÖ JSON mapping is accurate and matches the MCP server."]

### Missing Tools (in JSON but not in MCP)

| Toolset | Tool Name | Status |
|---------|-----------|--------|
| [toolset] | [tool] | Not found in MCP server |

### Extra Tools (in MCP but not in JSON)

| Toolset | Tool Name | Action Taken |
|---------|-----------|--------------|
| [toolset] | [tool] | Added to JSON mapping |

### Moved Tools

| Tool Name | JSON Toolset | MCP Toolset | Action Taken |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|--------------|
| [tool] | [old] | [new] | Updated in JSON mapping |

**Action**: [If discrepancies were found and fixed, state: "Created pull request with updated JSON mapping." Otherwise: "No updates needed."]

## Changes Since Last Report

[Only include this section if previous data exists]

### New Tools Added ‚ú®

List any tools that were added since the last report, organized by toolsets:

| Toolset | Tool Name | Purpose |
|---------|-----------|---------|
| [toolset] | [tool] | [description] |

### Removed Tools üóëÔ∏è

List any tools that were removed since the last report:

| Toolset | Tool Name | Purpose (from previous report) |
|---------|-----------|--------------------------------|
| [toolset] | [tool] | [description] |

### Tools Moved Between Toolsets üîÑ

List any tools that changed their toolset categorization:

| Tool Name | Previous Toolset | Current Toolset | Notes |
|-----------|------------------|-----------------|-------|
| [tool] | [old toolset] | [new toolset] | [reason] |

[If no changes: "No tools were added, removed, or moved since the last report."]

## Tools by Toolset

Organize tools into their respective toolset categories. For each toolset that has tools, create a section with a table listing all tools.

**Example format for each toolsets:**

### [Toolset Name] Toolset
Brief description of the toolset.

| Tool Name | Purpose | Key Parameters |
|-----------|---------|----------------|
| [tool]    | [description] | [params] |

**All available toolsets**: context, repos, issues, pull_requests, actions, code_security, dependabot, discussions, experiments, gists, labels, notifications, orgs, projects, secret_protection, security_advisories, stargazers, users

## Recommended Default Toolsets

Based on the analysis of available tools and their usage patterns, the following toolsets are recommended as defaults when no toolset is specified:

**Recommended Defaults**: [List recommended toolsets here, e.g., `context`, `repos`, `issues`, `pull_requests`, `users`]

**Rationale**:
- [Explain why each toolset should be included in defaults]
- [Consider frequency of use, fundamental functionality, minimal security exposure]
- [Note any changes from current defaults and why]

**Specialized Toolsets** (enable explicitly when needed):
- List toolsets that should not be in defaults and when to use them

## Toolset Configuration Reference

When configuring the GitHub MCP server in agentic workflows, you can enable specific toolsets:

```yaml
tools:
  github:
    mode: "remote"  # or "local"
    toolsets: [all]  # or specific toolsets like [repos, issues, pull_requests]
```

**Available toolset options**:
- `context` - GitHub Actions context and environment
- `repos` - Repository operations
- `issues` - Issue management
- `pull_requests` - Pull request operations
- `actions` - GitHub Actions workflows
- `code_security` - Code scanning alerts
- `dependabot` - Dependabot alerts
- `discussions` - GitHub Discussions
- `experiments` - Experimental features
- `gists` - Gist operations
- `labels` - Label management
- `notifications` - Notification management
- `orgs` - Organization operations
- `projects` - GitHub Projects
- `secret_protection` - Secret scanning
- `security_advisories` - Security advisories
- `stargazers` - Repository stars
- `users` - User information
- `all` - Enable all toolsets

6. **Detect inconsistencies**: Check for duplicates, miscategorization, naming issues, and orphaned tools
7. **Compare and analyze**: If previous data exists, compare current tools with previous tools to identify changes (new/removed/moved)
8. **Analyze and recommend default toolsets**: 
   - Analyze which toolsets provide the most fundamental functionality
   - Consider which tools are most commonly needed across different workflow types
   - Evaluate the current defaults: `context`, `repos`, `issues`, `pull_requests`, `users`
   - Determine if these defaults should be updated based on actual tool availability and usage patterns
   - Document your rationale for the recommended defaults
9. **Create comprehensive documentation file**: Create/update `.github/instructions/github-mcp-server.instructions.md` with:
   - Overview of GitHub MCP server (remote vs local mode)
   - Complete list of available tools organized by toolset
