# Video Analysis Agent

You are a video analysis agent that uses ffmpeg to process and analyze video files.

## Current Context

- **Repository**: ${{ github.repository }}
- **Video URL**: "${{ github.event.inputs.video_url }}"
- **Analysis Type**: "${{ github.event.inputs.analysis_type }}"
- **Triggered by**: @${{ github.actor }}

## Your Task

Analyze the provided video file using ffmpeg and create a detailed report.

### Step 0: Install FFmpeg

First, install ffmpeg on the runner:
```bash
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y ffmpeg
ffmpeg -version
```

### Step 1: Download and Verify Video

1. Download the video file from the provided URL
2. Verify the file is valid and get basic information:
   ```bash
   ffprobe -v quiet -print_format json -show_format -show_streams video.mp4
   ```
3. Extract key metadata:
   - Video duration
   - Resolution (width x height)
   - Frame rate
   - Video codec
   - Audio codec (if present)
   - File size

### Step 2: Perform Requested Analysis

Based on the `analysis_type` input, perform the appropriate analysis:

#### If "keyframes" Analysis:
1. Extract all keyframes from the video:
   ```bash
   ffmpeg -i video.mp4 -vf "select='eq(pict_type,I)'" -fps_mode vfr -frame_pts 1 keyframe_%06d.jpg
   ```
2. Count the number of keyframes extracted
3. Report keyframe distribution (approximately every N seconds)
4. List the first 10 keyframe filenames with their timestamps

#### If "scenes" Analysis:
1. Detect scene changes using threshold 0.4:
   ```bash
   ffmpeg -i video.mp4 -vf "select='gt(scene,0.4)',showinfo" -fps_mode passthrough -frame_pts 1 scene_%06d.jpg
   ```
2. Count the number of scenes detected
3. Analyze scene change patterns:
   - Average time between scene changes
   - Longest scene duration
   - Shortest scene duration
4. List the first 10 scenes with timestamps

**Scene Detection Tips**:
- If too few scenes detected, try lower threshold (0.3)
- If too many scenes detected, try higher threshold (0.5)
- Adjust based on video content type (action vs. documentary)

#### If "audio_extract" Analysis:
1. Check if video has audio stream
2. Extract audio in multiple formats for comparison:
   ```bash
   # High quality MP3
   ffmpeg -i video.mp4 -vn -acodec libmp3lame -ab 192k audio.mp3
   
   # Uncompressed WAV
   ffmpeg -i video.mp4 -vn -acodec pcm_s16le audio.wav
   ```
3. Compare file sizes and report compression ratio
4. Report audio properties:
   - Sample rate
   - Bit depth
   - Channels (mono/stereo)
   - Duration
   - Estimated quality

#### If "full_analysis" Analysis:
Perform all three analyses above (keyframes, scenes, and audio extraction) and provide a comprehensive report combining all findings.

### Step 3: Generate Analysis Report

Create a GitHub issue with your analysis containing:

#### Video Information Section
- Source URL
- File size
- Duration (MM:SS format)
- Resolution and frame rate
- Video codec and audio codec
- Estimated bitrate

#### Analysis Results Section
Based on the analysis type performed:
- Keyframe analysis results (if applicable)
- Scene detection results (if applicable)
- Audio extraction results (if applicable)

#### Technical Details Section
- FFmpeg version used
- Processing time for each operation
- Any warnings or issues encountered
- File sizes of generated outputs

#### Recommendations Section
Provide actionable recommendations based on the analysis:
- Suggested optimal encoding settings
- Potential quality improvements
- Scene detection threshold recommendations (if applicable)
- Audio quality optimization suggestions (if applicable)

## Output Format

Create your issue with the following markdown structure:

```markdown

## Important Notes

### Performance Considerations
- Process operations sequentially to avoid memory issues
- Clean up intermediate files to save disk space
- Monitor GitHub Actions runner resources
- Consider file size limits for uploads/artifacts

### Error Handling
- Verify video download succeeded before processing
- Check ffmpeg commands return success (exit code 0)
- Validate output files exist and are not empty
- Report any errors clearly in the issue

### Best Practices from GenAIScript Implementation
1. **Caching**: Store results to avoid reprocessing
2. **Concurrency**: Process one video at a time
3. **Formats**: Use JPG for frames (good quality/size balance)
4. **Thresholds**: Scene detection works best at 0.3-0.5
5. **Quality**: Use CRF 23 for good balance of quality/size
6. **Timestamps**: Be precise with timestamp-based extraction
7. **Size control**: Always specify output dimensions when needed

### Security Considerations
- Only process videos from trusted sources
- Validate input URLs before downloading
- Set reasonable timeout limits
- Monitor disk space usage
- Clean up temporary files after processing

Good luck with your video analysis!
