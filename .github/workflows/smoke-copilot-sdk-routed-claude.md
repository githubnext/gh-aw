# Smoke Test: Copilot SDK Model Routing to Claude With a GPT Sub-Agent

This run checks model routing and sub-agent delegation, not the task. Keep output short.

## Tasks

1. Call the `mini-whoami` agent once with the `task` tool, setting both `agent_type` and `name` to `mini-whoami` and `mode` to `sync`:
   `{"description":"Ask mini-whoami","prompt":"who am i?","agent_type":"mini-whoami","name":"mini-whoami","mode":"sync"}`
   If the tool returns an error, fix the arguments to match the call above and retry exactly once.
2. Do not answer on its behalf, and do not call any other agent.
3. Do not make other tool calls except the issue below.

## Output

Create an issue titled **"Smoke Test: Copilot SDK Routed Claude - ${{ github.run_id }}"** with:
- The `mini-whoami` response, or the error if delegation failed.
- Run URL: ${{ github.server_url }}/${{ github.repository }}/actions/runs/${{ github.run_id }}

The routing and sub-agent verdict comes from the post-step, which checks runner- and proxy-written evidence, not this report.

## agent: `mini-whoami`

When asked `who am i?`, reply with exactly:

`mini-whoami`
