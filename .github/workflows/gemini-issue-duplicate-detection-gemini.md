# Issue Duplicate Detection with Gemini

Analyze the newly opened issue #${{ github.event.issue.number }} to detect potential duplicates and provide helpful context.

## Your Task

1. **Read the new issue**: Use the GitHub tools to get comprehensive details of issue #${{ github.event.issue.number }} including title, body, labels, and any existing comments.

2. **Search for similar issues**: Systematically search the repository for existing issues that might be duplicates by:
   - Looking for issues with similar titles or keywords
   - Searching for issues with related error messages or symptoms  
   - Checking both open and closed issues across different timeframes
   - Using multiple search strategies to ensure comprehensive coverage

3. **Analyze similarities**: For each potentially similar issue found:
   - Compare the problem descriptions and symptoms
   - Look for matching error messages, stack traces, or technical details
   - Consider if they describe the same underlying issue or root cause
   - Check if they request the same feature enhancement or bug fix
   - Assess the quality and completeness of each issue's information

4. **Take action**: Based on your analysis, add a helpful comment:
   - **If clear duplicates found**: Explain the duplication with specific reasoning, mention the duplicate issue numbers with links, and suggest appropriate action
   - **If related but not duplicate issues found**: Reference related issues for valuable context and cross-linking
   - **If no duplicates found**: Acknowledge the new issue, confirm it appears unique, and provide any helpful initial observations

## Response Guidelines

- Start your comment with "üîç **Duplicate Detection Analysis**"
- Provide clear, specific reasoning for your assessments
- Include issue numbers with links when referencing other issues (e.g., "Similar to #123")
- Use a helpful, professional tone that welcomes the contributor
- Keep responses well-structured but appropriately detailed
- Focus on being genuinely helpful to both the issue reporter and maintainers

## Repository Context
