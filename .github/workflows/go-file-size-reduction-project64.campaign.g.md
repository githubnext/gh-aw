# Campaign Orchestrator

This workflow orchestrates the 'Go File Size Reduction Campaign (Project 64)' campaign.

- Tracker label: `campaign:go-file-size-reduction-project64`
- Associated workflows: daily-file-diet
- Memory paths: memory/campaigns/go-file-size-reduction-project64-*/**
- Metrics glob: `memory/campaigns/go-file-size-reduction-project64-*/metrics/*.json`
- Project URL: https://github.com/orgs/githubnext/projects/64

Each time this orchestrator runs on its daily schedule (or when manually dispatched), generate a concise status report for this campaign. Summarize current metrics and monitor the progress of associated worker workflows.

**Tracking Worker Output**: The campaign has knowledge of its workers (listed in the `workflows` field) and monitors their output via tracker-id. Each worker workflow has a unique tracker-id that gets embedded in all created assets. The orchestrator discovers issues created by workers by searching for this tracker-id:

1. **Search for issues created by workers** using the GitHub MCP server:
   - For each worker in the `workflows` list, determine its tracker-id (e.g., `daily-file-diet`)
   - Search for issues in the repository containing the tracker-id HTML comment: `<!-- tracker-id: WORKER_TRACKER_ID -->`
   - Use `github-search_issues` to find issues containing the tracker-id in their body
   - Example query: `repo:owner/repo "<!-- tracker-id: daily-file-diet -->" in:body`
   
2. **Filter discovered issues**:
   - Focus on recently created or updated issues (within the last week)
   - Check if issues are already on the project board to avoid duplicates
   - Identify new issues that need to be added to the board
   
3. **Add discovered issues to the project board**:
   - Use `update-project` safe-output to add issue URLs to the project board
   - Set appropriate status fields (e.g., "Todo", "In Progress", "Done")
   - Preserve any existing project item metadata
   
4. **Update project board status**:
   - For issues already on the board, check their current state (open/closed)
   - Update project board fields to reflect current status
   - Move items between columns as appropriate (e.g., closed issues to "Done")
   
5. **Report on campaign progress**:
   - Count total issues discovered via tracker-id
   - Track open vs closed issues
   - Calculate progress percentage
   - Highlight any issues that need attention

Workers operate independently without knowledge of the campaign. The orchestrator discovers their work by searching for issues containing the worker's tracker-id, which is automatically embedded in all created assets.

**Understanding Empty Boards**: If you find zero items on the project board, this is normal when a campaign is just starting or when all work has been completed. This is not an error condition - simply report the current state. Worker workflows will create issues as they discover work to be done, and the orchestrator will add them to the board on subsequent runs.


If all issues tracked by the campaign are closed, the campaign is complete. This is a normal terminal state indicating successful completion, not a blocker or error. When the campaign is complete, mark the project as finished and take no further action. Do not report closed issues as blockers.

Keep the campaign Project dashboard in sync using the `update-project` safe output. When calling update-project, use the `project` field with this exact URL: https://github.com/orgs/githubnext/projects/64

Use these details to coordinate workers, update metrics, and track progress for this campaign.
