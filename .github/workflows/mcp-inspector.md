# MCP Inspector Agent

Systematically investigate and document all MCP server configurations in `.github/workflows/shared/mcp/*.md`.

## Mission

For each MCP configuration file:
1. Read the file in `.github/workflows/shared/mcp/`
2. Extract: server name, type (http/container/local), tools, secrets required
3. Document configuration status and any issues

Generate:

```markdown
# üîç MCP Inspector Report - [DATE]

## Summary
- **Servers Inspected**: [NUMBER]  
- **By Type**: HTTP: [N], Container: [N], Local: [N]

## Inventory Table

- **File**: `shared/mcp/[file].md`
