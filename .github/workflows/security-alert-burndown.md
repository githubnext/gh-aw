# Security Alert Burndown

This workflow discovers security alert work items in the githubnext/gh-aw repository and updates the project board with their status:

- Dependabot-created PRs for JavaScript dependency updates

## Task

You need to discover and update security work items on the project board. Follow these steps:

### Step 1: Discover Dependabot PRs

Use the GitHub MCP server to search for pull requests in the `githubnext/gh-aw` repository with:
- Author: `app/dependabot`
- Labels: `dependencies`, `javascript`
- State: open

Example search query:
```
repo:githubnext/gh-aw is:pr author:app/dependabot label:dependencies label:javascript is:open
```

### Step 2: Check for Work

If *no* Dependabot PRs are found:
- Call the `noop` tool with message: "No security alerts found to process"
- Exit successfully

### Step 3: Update Project Board

For each discovered item (up to 100 total per run):
- Add or update the corresponding work item on the project board:
- Use the `update-project` safe output tool
- Always include the campaign project URL (this is what makes it a campaign):
  - `project`: "https://github.com/orgs/githubnext/projects/144"
- Always include the content identity:
  - `content_type`: `pull_request` (Dependabot PRs)
  - `content_number`: PR/issue number
- Set fields:
  - `campaign_id`: "security-alert-burndown"
  - `status`: "Todo" (for open items)
  - `target_repo`: "githubnext/gh-aw"
  - `worker_workflow`: who discovered it, using one of:
    - "dependabot"
  - `priority`: Estimate priority:
    - "High" for critical/severe alerts
    - "Medium" for moderate alerts
    - "Low" for low/none alerts
  - `size`: Estimate size:
    - "Small" for single dependency updates
    - "Medium" for multiple dependency updates
    - "Large" for complex updates with breaking changes
  - `start_date`: Item created date (YYYY-MM-DD format)
  - `end_date`: Item closed date (YYYY-MM-DD format) or today's date if still open

### Step 4: Create parent issue and assign work

After updating project items, you must complete **all three actions below in order**:

1. **Create the parent tracking issue** 
2. **Add the issue to the project board**
3. **Assign the issue to the Copilot agent**

**Selection Criteria:**
1. Review all discovered PRs
2. Group by **runtime** (Node.js, Python, etc.) and **target dependency file**
3. Select up to **3 bundles** total following the bundling rules below

**Dependabot Bundling Rules:**

- Group work by **runtime** (Node.js, Python, etc.). Never mix runtimes.
- Group changes by **target dependency file**. Each PR must modify **one manifest (and its lockfile) only**.
- Bundle updates **only within a single target file**.
- Patch and minor updates **may be bundled**; major updates **should be isolated** unless dependencies are tightly coupled.
- Bundled releases **must include a research report** describing:
  - Packages updated and old → new versions
  - Breaking or behavioral changes
  - Migration steps or code impact
  - Risk level and test coverage impact
- Prioritize **security alerts and high-risk updates** first within each runtime.
- Enforce **one runtime + one target file per PR**.
- All PRs must pass **CI and relevant runtime tests** before merge.

**Action 1: Create the parent issue**

Create a single issue that contains:
- The bundling rules (copied below)
- The proposed bundles (grouped by runtime + target manifest)
- A checklist of the PRs to bundle, one checkbox per PR

Use the `create_issue` tool:

```
create_issue(title="Security Alert Burndown: Dependabot bundling plan (YYYY-MM-DD)", body="<paste body from template below>")
```

After calling `create_issue`, **store the returned issue number** - you will need it for actions 2 and 3.

**Action 2: Add the issue to the project board**

Immediately after creating the issue, add it to the project board using `update_project`. Use the issue number from action 1:

```
update_project(
  project="https://github.com/orgs/githubnext/projects/144",
  content_type="issue",
  content_number=<new_issue_number>,
  fields={
    "campaign_id": "security-alert-burndown",
    "status": "Todo",
    "target_repo": "githubnext/gh-aw",
    "worker_workflow": "dependabot",
    "priority": "High",
    "size": "Medium",
    "start_date": "YYYY-MM-DD"
  }
)
```

**Action 3: Assign the issue to the agent**

Finally, assign the issue to the Copilot agent using `assign_to_agent`. Use the issue number from action 1:

```
assign_to_agent(issue_number=<new_issue_number>, name="copilot")
```

**CRITICAL**: You must call all three tools (create_issue, update_project, assign_to_agent) in sequence to complete this step. Do not skip any of them.


**Issue Body Template:**
```markdown
## Context
This issue tracks Dependabot PR bundling work discovered by the Security Alert Burndown campaign.

## Bundling Rules
- Group work by runtime. Never mix runtimes.
- Group changes by target dependency file (one manifest + its lockfile).
- Patch/minor updates may be bundled; major updates should be isolated unless tightly coupled.
- Bundled releases must include a research report (packages, versions, breaking changes, migration, risk, tests).

## Planned Bundles

### [runtime] — [manifest file]
PRs:
- [ ] #123 - [title] ([old] → [new])
- [ ] #456 - [title] ([old] → [new])

### [runtime] — [manifest file]
PRs:
- [ ] #789 - [title] ([old] → [new])

## Agent Task
1. For each bundle section above, research each update for breaking changes and summarize risks.
2. Bundle PRs per section into a single PR (one runtime + one manifest).
3. Ensure CI passes; run relevant runtime tests.
4. Add the research report to the bundled PR.
5. Update this issue checklist as PRs are merged.
```

### Step 5: Report

Summarize how many items were discovered and added/updated on the project board, broken down by category, and include the parent tracking issue number that was created and assigned.

## Important

- Always use the `update-project` tool for project board updates
- If no work is found, call `noop` to indicate successful completion with no actions
- Focus only on open items:
  - PRs: open only
- Limit updates to 100 items per run to respect rate limits (prioritize highest severity/most recent first)
