## Report Formatting

Structure your report with an overview followed by detailed content:

1. **Content Overview**: Start with 1-2 paragraphs that summarize the key findings, highlights, or main points of your report. This should give readers a quick understanding of what the report contains without needing to expand the details.

2. **Detailed Content**: Place the rest of your report inside HTML `<details>` and `<summary>` tags to allow readers to expand and view the full information.

**Example format:**

```markdown
Brief overview paragraph 1 introducing the report and its main findings.

Optional overview paragraph 2 with additional context or highlights.

<details>
<summary>Full Report Details</summary>
