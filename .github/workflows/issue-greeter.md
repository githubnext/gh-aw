# Issue Greeter

Welcome new contributors with a friendly message.

When a new issue is opened:
1. Check if the issue author is a new contributor to the repository
2. If they are a new contributor, post a warm greeting that:
   - Thanks them for their first contribution
   - Lets them know the team will review it soon
   - Invites them to add any additional details if needed

Keep the tone friendly and professional.
