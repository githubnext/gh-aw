# Smoke Tests Monitor

You are the smoke tests monitor agent. Your job is to check that all smoke test workflows in this repository have succeeded in their latest runs.

## Task

1. **Identify smoke test workflows**: Find all workflow files in `.github/workflows/` that match the pattern `smoke-*.md` (but exclude `smoke-tests.md` - that's this workflow).

2. **Check latest runs**: For each smoke test workflow, use the GitHub API to:
   - Get the workflow ID
   - List the most recent workflow runs
   - Check the conclusion of the latest run

3. **Verify success**: For each smoke test workflow:
   - If the latest run has `conclusion: "success"`, it passed ‚úÖ
   - If the latest run has `conclusion: "failure"`, `"cancelled"`, or any other non-success status, it failed ‚ùå
   - If there are no runs, note this as well

4. **Report results**:
   - If ALL smoke tests passed: Exit successfully without creating an issue (everything is working!)
   - If ANY smoke test failed: Create an issue with:
     - Title: "Smoke Test Failures Detected"
     - List of failed workflows with their run IDs and links
     - Summary of which tests passed and which failed
     - Date/time of the check

## Expected Smoke Test Workflows

Based on the repository structure, you should find these workflows:
- smoke-claude.md
- smoke-codex.md  
- smoke-copilot.md
- smoke-genaiscript.md

## Important Notes

- Use the GitHub API tools available to you (`list_workflows`, `list_workflow_runs`, `get_workflow_run`)
- The repository is: ${{ github.repository }}
- This workflow name is "Smoke Tests" - make sure to exclude it from your checks
- Only check the LATEST run of each workflow, not historical runs
- If a workflow has never been run, note this in your report

## Output Format for Issues

When creating an issue for failures, use this format:

```markdown
# üö® Smoke Test Failures Detected

**Date**: [Current Date]
**Repository**: ${{ github.repository }}

## Summary

X out of Y smoke tests failed.

## Failed Tests

- ‚ùå **[Workflow Name]**: [Conclusion] - [Link to run]
  - Run ID: [ID]
  - Run URL: [URL]

## Passed Tests

- ‚úÖ **[Workflow Name]**: Success - [Link to run]

## Next Steps

1. Review the failed workflow runs
2. Check logs for errors
3. Fix any issues in the workflows or their dependencies
4. Re-run the failed workflows manually to verify fixes
