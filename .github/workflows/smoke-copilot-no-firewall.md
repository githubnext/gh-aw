# Smoke Test: Copilot Engine Validation (No Firewall)

**IMPORTANT: Keep all outputs extremely short and concise. Use single-line responses where possible. No verbose explanations.**

## Test Requirements

1. **GitHub MCP Testing**: Review the last 2 merged pull requests in ${{ github.repository }}
2. **File Writing Testing**: Create a test file `/tmp/smoke-test-copilot-${{ github.run_id }}.txt` with content "Smoke test passed for Copilot at $(date)"
3. **Bash Tool Testing**: Execute bash commands to verify file creation was successful (use `cat` to read the file back)
4. **Playwright MCP Testing**: Use playwright to navigate to https://github.com and verify the page title contains "GitHub"

## Output

Add a **very brief** comment (max 5-10 lines) to the current pull request with:
- PR titles only (no descriptions)
- ✅ or ❌ for each test result
- Overall status: PASS or FAIL

**Also append** a summary to the pull request description using `update_pull_request` with operation "append". Include:
- Test timestamp
- Overall status (PASS/FAIL)
- Brief one-line summary

If all tests pass, add the label `smoke-copilot-no-firewall` to the pull request.
