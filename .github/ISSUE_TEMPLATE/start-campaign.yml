        ## Start a Campaign with AI Assistance
        
        Our AI campaign expert will help you create a comprehensive campaign specification. Just provide:
        1. Your project board URL (for tracking)
        2. A simple description of what you want to achieve
        
        The AI will generate all the technical details, best practices, and governance policies for you.
        
        **What happens next:**
        1. An AI agent analyzes your goal and generates a complete campaign spec
        2. The spec includes recommended workflows, memory paths, approval policies, and more
        3. A pull request is created automatically with the generated files
        4. Review and merge the PR to activate your campaign

        ### How it works
        
        After submitting:
        1. **This issue becomes your campaign hub** - Track everything here
        2. **AI generates a comprehensive spec** - Including workflows, governance, and metrics
        3. **A PR is created automatically** - Contains campaign spec and orchestrator files
        4. **Review and merge** - Activate your campaign once you're satisfied
        
        The AI will handle all the technical details and best practices for you!
