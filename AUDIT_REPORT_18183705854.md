## Analysis

### Workflow Type
This is an **agentic workflow** using the **GitHub Copilot CLI** engine, as indicated by:
- "Install GitHub Copilot CLI" step
- "Execute GitHub Copilot CLI" step (88 seconds of AI processing)
- Safe outputs MCP setup
- Agent output artifacts

### Performance Metrics
- **Total Duration**: ~3.7 minutes
- **Setup Time**: ~2 minutes (dependencies, Node.js, Go, Copilot CLI)
- **Agent Execution Time**: ~88 seconds
- **Artifact Upload Time**: ~4 seconds

### Engine Configuration
The workflow uses:
- **Engine**: GitHub Copilot CLI (copilot)
- **MCP Servers**: Safe Outputs Collector configured
- **Outputs**: Safe outputs enabled (but no outputs were actually created since safe-output-related jobs were skipped)

### Success Indicators
✓ All critical jobs completed successfully
✓ No errors in job execution
✓ All artifacts uploaded successfully  
✓ Agent execution completed without failures
✓ Git patch generated (indicating potential code changes)

### Observations
1. The workflow is a "Tidy" workflow that likely performs code formatting or cleanup
2. It successfully executed with GitHub Copilot CLI as the coding agent
3. The agent execution took 88 seconds, which is reasonable for code formatting tasks
4. Safe output jobs (create_pull_request, push_to_pull_request_branch) were skipped, suggesting no actual changes were needed or the workflow didn't produce safe outputs
5. The missing_tool job was skipped, indicating no missing tools were reported

## How to Use `gh-aw audit`

To audit this workflow run using the specialized log analyzing capabilities:

```bash
# Audit by run ID
gh aw audit 18183705854

# Audit by URL
gh aw audit https://github.com/githubnext/gh-aw/actions/runs/18183705854

# Audit with verbose output
gh aw audit 18183705854 -v

# Audit with custom output directory
gh aw audit 18183705854 -o ./my-audit-logs
```

### For Restricted Environments

If you encounter permission errors, the audit command will guide you to download artifacts using the GitHub MCP server:

```bash
# Step 1: Try audit (may fail with permission error)
gh aw audit 18183705854

# Step 2: Follow instructions to download using MCP server
# Use github-mcp-server tool 'download_workflow_run_artifacts'
# with run_id: 18183705854 and output_directory: logs/run-18183705854

# Step 3: Run audit again to process cached artifacts
gh aw audit 18183705854
```

## Conclusion

Workflow run **18183705854** completed successfully with no errors. The "Tidy" agentic workflow executed using GitHub Copilot CLI and completed all required steps. The workflow appears to be a code formatting/cleanup automation that ran successfully on the main branch after commit a8605a67.

All artifacts are available for download and detailed analysis. The specialized log analyzing capabilities of `gh-aw audit` would provide additional metrics including:
- Token usage and estimated costs
- Detailed MCP tool call statistics
- Error and warning analysis from logs
- Missing tool reports (if any)
- Code change analysis from git patches
