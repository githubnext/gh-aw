# ✨ GitHub Agentic Workflows

Write agentic workflows in natural language markdown, and run them safely in GitHub Actions. From [GitHub Next](https://githubnext.com/) and [Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/research-software-engineering-rise/).

> [!WARNING]
> This extension is a research demonstrator. It is in early development and may change significantly. Using agentic workflows in your repository requires careful attention to security considerations and careful human supervision, and even then things can still go wrong. Use it with caution, and at your own risk.

## 🚀 Quick Start

Ready to get your first agentic workflow running? Follow our step-by-step [Quick Start Guide](https://githubnext.github.io/gh-aw/start-here/quick-start/) to install the extension, add a sample workflow, and see it in action.

## 📖 Overview

Learn about the concepts behind agentic workflows, explore available workflow types, and understand how AI can automate your repository tasks. See [Concepts](https://githubnext.github.io/gh-aw/start-here/concepts/).

## 🔧 How It Works

GitHub Agentic Workflows transforms natural language markdown files into GitHub Actions that are executed by AI agents. Here's a simple example:

```markdown
---
on:
  issues:
    types: [opened]

permissions: read-all 

safe-outputs:
  add-comment:
---

# Issue Clarifier

Analyze the current issue and ask for additional details if the issue is unclear.
```

The `gh aw` cli converts this into a GitHub Actions Workflow (.yml) that runs an AI agent (Copilot, Claude, Codex, ...) in a containerized environment whenever a new issue is opened in the repository.

The AI agent reads your repository context, understands the issue content, and takes appropriate actions - all defined in natural language rather than complex code.

**Security Benefits:** Workflows use read-only permissions by default, with write operations only allowed through sanitized `safe-outputs`. Access can be gated to team members only, ensuring AI agents operate within controlled boundaries.
