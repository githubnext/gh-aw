## Quick Start

Ready to get your first agentic workflow running? Follow our step-by-step [Quick Start Guide](https://github.github.com/gh-aw/setup/quick-start/) to install the extension, add a sample workflow, and see it in action.

## Overview

Learn about the concepts behind agentic workflows, explore available workflow types, and understand how AI can automate your repository tasks. See [How It Works](https://github.github.com/gh-aw/introduction/how-they-work/).

## Guardrails

Guardrails, safety and security are foundational to GitHub Agentic Workflows. Workflows run with read-only permissions by default, with write operations only allowed through sanitized `safe-outputs`. The system implements multiple layers of protection including sandboxed execution, input sanitization, network isolation, supply chain security (SHA-pinned dependencies), tool allow-listing, and compile-time validation. Access can be gated to team members only, with human approval gates for critical operations, ensuring AI agents operate safely within controlled boundaries. See the [Security Architecture](https://github.github.com/gh-aw/introduction/architecture/) for comprehensive details on threat modeling, implementation guidelines, and best practices.

Using agentic workflows in your repository requires careful attention to security considerations and careful human supervision, and even then things can still go wrong. Use it with caution, and at your own risk.

## Documentation

For complete documentation, examples, and guides, see the [Documentation](https://github.github.com/gh-aw/).

## YAML Library Choice

This project uses [goccy/go-yaml](https://github.com/goccy/go-yaml) for YAML processing instead of the more commonly used `go-yaml/yaml`.

### Why goccy/go-yaml?

- **More test passes**: goccy/go-yaml passes 60+ more YAML Test Suite tests than go-yaml/yaml
- **Better error messages**: Provides source code context in error messages, making debugging easier
- **Active maintenance**: Regular commits and improvements (latest from 2026-02-16!)
- **Native Go implementation**: Pure Go implementation, not a C port
- **Advanced features**: Supports YAML Path, AST manipulation, and other advanced capabilities

### Usage Example

```go
import "github.com/goccy/go-yaml"

// Decode YAML
var data struct {
    Name string `yaml:"name"`
    Age  int    `yaml:"age"`
}
if err := yaml.Unmarshal([]byte(yamlString), &data); err != nil {
    // Error message includes file and line number
    fmt.Printf("Error at line %d: %v\n", err.Line(), err)
}
```

For more best practices, see the [goccy/go-yaml documentation](https://github.com/goccy/go-yaml).

## Related Projects

GitHub Agentic Workflows is supported by companion projects that provide additional security and integration capabilities:

- **[Agent Workflow Firewall (AWF)](https://github.com/github/gh-aw-firewall)** - Network egress control for AI agents, providing domain-based access controls and activity logging for secure workflow execution
- **[MCP Gateway](https://github.com/github/gh-aw-mcpg)** - Routes Model Context Protocol (MCP) server calls through a unified HTTP gateway for centralized access management
