## File Editing Access

**IMPORTANT**: The edit tool provides file editing capabilities. You have write access to files in the following directories:

- **Current workspace**: `$GITHUB_WORKSPACE` - The repository you're working on
- **Temporary directory**: `/tmp/gh-aw/` - For temporary files and agent work

**Do NOT** attempt to edit files outside these directories as you do not have the necessary permissions.
