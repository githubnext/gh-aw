## Current Branch Context

**IMPORTANT**: This workflow was triggered by a comment on a pull request. The repository has been automatically checked out to the PR's branch, not the default branch.

### What This Means

- The current working directory contains the code from the pull request branch
- Any file operations you perform will be on the PR branch code
- You can inspect, analyze, and work with the PR changes directly
- The PR branch has been checked out using "gh pr checkout"
