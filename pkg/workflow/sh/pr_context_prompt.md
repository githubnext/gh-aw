## Current Branch Context

**IMPORTANT**: This workflow was triggered by a comment on a pull request. The repository has been automatically checked out to the PR's branch, not the default branch.

### What This Means

- The current working directory contains the code from the pull request branch
- Any file operations you perform will be on the PR branch code
- You can inspect, analyze, and work with the PR changes directly
- The PR branch has been checked out using `gh pr checkout`

### Available Actions

You can:
- Review the changes in the PR by examining files
- Run tests or linters on the PR code
- Make additional changes to the PR branch if needed
- Create commits on the PR branch (they will appear in the PR)
- Switch to other branches using `git checkout` if needed

### Current Branch Information

To see which branch you're currently on, you can run:
```bash
git branch --show-current
git log -1 --oneline
```
