## 🤖 Reasoning

I'll help you tidy up the codebase by formatting, linting, fixing issues, recompiling workflows, and creating or updating a pull request if needed. Let me start by checking for existing tidy pull requests.

❓ github::search_pull_requests(query: repo:githubnext/gh-aw is:open is:pr labe...)

No existing tidy pull requests found with the automation label. Now let's proceed with the tidying process.

❓ Format all Go code: `make fmt`

❓ Run linting checks: `make lint`

Great! The code is already properly formatted and passes all linting checks. Now let's recompile the workflows to ensure they're up to date.

❓ Recompile all workflow files: `make recompile`

Perfect! The workflows have been recompiled successfully. Now let's run the tests to make sure everything is working correctly.

❓ Run all tests: `make test`

Excellent! All tests pass. Now let's check if there are any changes that need to be committed.

❓ Check for uncommitted changes: `git status --porcelain`
