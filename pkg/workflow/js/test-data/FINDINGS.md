# Copilot Log Parser - Format Mismatch Discovery

## Summary

Downloaded actual Copilot CLI logs from workflow run [#18296543175](https://github.com/githubnext/gh-aw/actions/runs/18296543175/job/52095988377#step:19:1) and discovered a format mismatch between the parser's expectations and actual Copilot CLI output.

## What Was Done

1. ✅ Downloaded artifacts from the specified workflow run
2. ✅ Extracted the Copilot CLI logs (`9843a065-22e7-4b08-a00f-5cf5b804aaad.log`)
3. ✅ Stored as sample logs in `pkg/workflow/js/test-data/copilot-raw-logs-run-18296543175.log`
4. ✅ Applied the transform using `parse_copilot_log.cjs`
5. ✅ Stored transformed output in `pkg/workflow/js/test-data/copilot-transformed-run-18296543175.md`
6. ✅ Created README documenting the format mismatch

## Key Finding

**The parser expects structured JSON format (like Claude logs), but Copilot CLI outputs debug logs.**

### Expected Format (What the Parser Looks For)
```json
[
  {"type": "system", "subtype": "init", "session_id": "...", "tools": [...]},
  {"type": "assistant", "message": {"content": [...]}},
  {"type": "user", "message": {"content": [...]}}
]
```

### Actual Format (What Copilot CLI Produces)
```
2025-10-06T22:48:23.111Z [INFO] Starting Copilot CLI: 0.0.335
2025-10-06T22:49:18.969Z [DEBUG] response (Request-ID ...):
2025-10-06T22:49:18.969Z [DEBUG] data:
2025-10-06T22:49:18.969Z [DEBUG] {
  "choices": [
    {
      "finish_reason": "tool_calls",
      "message": {
        "content": "Perfect! The workflows have been recompiled...",
        "role": "assistant",
        "tool_calls": [...]
      }
    }
  ],
  "usage": {...}
}
```

## Transform Result

The parser now successfully handles both formats:

**Structured JSON format** (original implementation):
```json
[
  {"type": "system", "subtype": "init", ...},
  {"type": "assistant", "message": {...}},
  ...
]
```

**Debug log format** (newly implemented - Option 1):
- Extracts JSON responses from `[DEBUG] data:` blocks
- Reconstructs the conversation flow from API responses
- Maintains backward compatibility with JSON format

The updated parser automatically detects which format is being used and processes it accordingly.

## Next Steps (Options)

### ✅ Option 1: Update Parser to Handle Debug Logs (IMPLEMENTED)
- ✅ Add support for parsing Copilot CLI debug log format
- ✅ Extract JSON responses from `[DEBUG] data:` blocks
- ✅ Reconstruct the conversation flow from API responses
- ✅ Maintain backward compatibility with JSON format

**Status**: The parser now supports both structured JSON and debug log formats. It automatically detects which format is being used and processes it accordingly.

### Option 2: Update Copilot CLI to Output Structured Logs
- Modify Copilot CLI to output structured JSON logs
- Match the format used by Claude for consistency
- Easier for parser to handle

### Option 3: Parser Detects and Handles Both Formats
- ✅ Auto-detect which format is being used (IMPLEMENTED)
- ✅ Handle both structured JSON and debug logs (IMPLEMENTED)
- Provides maximum flexibility

## Files Created

- `sample-logs/copilot-raw-logs-run-18296543175.log` - Raw Copilot CLI logs (152KB, excluded from git via .gitignore)
- `pkg/workflow/js/test-data/copilot-transformed-run-18296543175.md` - Transform result showing format mismatch (committed for review)
- `pkg/workflow/js/test-data/README.md` - Documentation of the format mismatch
- `pkg/workflow/js/test-data/FINDINGS.md` - This file with analysis and recommendations

**Note**: The raw log file is 152KB and excluded from git. To obtain it, download the artifact from the [workflow run](https://github.com/githubnext/gh-aw/actions/runs/18296543175/job/52095988377) or regenerate by running a Copilot CLI workflow.

## Recommendation

I recommend **Option 3** (dual format support) as it provides the most robust solution:
1. Parser can handle both current debug logs and future structured logs
2. Backward compatible with any existing implementations
3. Future-proof if Copilot CLI output format changes
