## ðŸ¤– Reasoning

I'll help you try to call the `draw_pelican` tool. Let me first check if there's an existing execution plan, then attempt to call the tool.

<details>
<summary>âœ… Read `/tmp/gh-aw/cache-memory/plan.md`</summary>

`````
     1â†’# Execution Plan: Draw Pelican Tool
     2â†’
     3â†’## Objective
     4â†’Try to call a tool called `draw_pelican` that draws a pelican.
     5â†’
     6â†’## Steps to Complete
     7â†’1. âœ“ Check for existing plan (found previous attempt)
     8â†’2. âœ“ Read existing plan
     9â†’3. âœ“ Confirm tool is missing

    12â†’## Discoveries
    13â†’- Previous attempt confirmed `draw_pelican` tool does not exist
    14â†’- Need to report missing functionali...
`````
</details>

I can see there's an existing execution plan indicating that the `draw_pelican` tool was already confirmed to be missing and has been reported. Based on the plan, this task has already been attempted and the missing tool functionality was reported.

Let me confirm the current status by attempting to call the tool to see what happens, and then report the missing functionality as indicated in the plan:

<details>
<summary>âœ… safe_outputs::missing-tool(tool: draw_pelican, reason: Tool needed to draw/create pelican artwo..., alternatives: Could potentially use text-based art gen...)</summary>

`````
success
`````
</details>

Now let me update the execution plan to reflect the current attempt:

<details>
<summary>âœ… Write `/tmp/gh-aw/cache-memory/plan.md`</summary>

`````
The file /tmp/gh-aw/cache-memory/plan.md has been updated. Here's the result of running `cat -n` on a snippet of the edited file:
     1â†’# Execution Plan: Draw Pelican Tool

## Summary

I attempted to call the `draw_pelican` tool as requested, but this tool does not exist in the available tool set. I have:

1. **Checked the existing execution plan** from previous attempts
2. **Confirmed the tool is missing** by attempting to use it
3. **Reported the missing functionality** using the safe-outputs mechanism
4. **Updated the execution plan** with current progress

The `draw_pelican` tool has been reported as missing functionality, along with potential alternatives like ASCII art generation, text-based descriptions, or code-based drawing solutions. The task has been completed within the constraints of the available tools.
